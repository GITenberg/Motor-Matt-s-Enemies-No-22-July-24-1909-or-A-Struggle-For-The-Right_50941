<p class="chaptitle">ON THE ROAD TO WAUNAKEE.</p>


<p>"Do you know what you're doing, John?"</p>

<p>"If I didn't, Ollie, I wouldn't be doing it. I'm not
one of these fellows who take a jump in the dark and
trust to luck."</p>

<p>"Then it's about time you put me wise. I've been
taking jumps in the dark ever since you showed up in
Madison yesterday."</p>

<p>The man with the closely cropped red hair, the smooth
face, and the mole on his cheek laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Back the car off the road and into the bushes," said
he, "then we'll sit where we can look around the bend
toward Waunakee and I'll tell you all you want to
know."</p>

<p>The young fellow with black hair and a sinister face
threw in the reverse and backed the big automobile off
the road and into the undergrowth. When he stopped
the car it was all but screened from sight. Jumping
down, he walked out to where the man was standing in
the highway thoughtfully smoking a big, black cigar.</p>

<p>Pulling a silver cigarette case from his pocket, Ollie
helped himself to a highly ornamental brand of Turkish
poison, each little cylinder cork-tipped and marked in
gilt with his monogram.</p>

<p>Big John looked at him with frank disapproval as he
took a silver matchbox from his vest and fired the imported
"paper pipe."</p>

<p>"You're the silver-plated boy, all right," muttered
Big John.</p>

<p>"Sterling, you big duffer," grinned Ollie. "Nothing
plated about me."</p>

<p>"The dope they roll up in that rice paper and hand
you with your cute little monogram is plate, all right&mdash;coffin
plate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, splash!" sneered Ollie. "You're a nice one to
lecture a fellow, I must say. Cut it out, John, and tell
me what we're here for."</p>

<p>Big John shook his red head forebodingly and moved
off toward the bend of the wooded road. Here he sat
down just within a fringe of brush, in such a position
that he had a good view of the straightaway stretch
toward Waunakee, and Ollie pushed in beside him.</p>

<p>"You know George Lorry, all right, eh, Ollie?" Big
John observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>A flush crossed Ollie's sinister face.</p>

<p>"You bet I know him!" said he. "The fellows used
to call him 'Sis,' because he was so nice and ladylike.
But I've known for a long time there was good stuff in
George, and that he'd be a first-rate chap if some one
would only cut him adrift from his mother's apron
strings. I got him started right," and a very complacent
look drifted over Ollie's dark features. "He can smoke
cigareets as well as the next one, now, and play as
good a game of cards as any fellow in our set. He's
got <i>me</i> to thank for that."</p>

<p>Big John stared at Ollie, and once more shook his
head.</p>

<p>"What fools you kids can make of yourselves!" he
grunted. "You're the one that started young Lorry,
eh?"</p>

<p>"He was a sissy," asserted Ollie, "and I was making a
man of him. George's folks never treated him right.
Old Lorry has got as much money as my governor, but
he's a tightwad, all right, and put the screws on George's
allowance in a way that was scandalous. George bought
a five-thousand-dollar motor launch, and had it sent on
here from Bay City, C. O. D., and his skinflint father
wouldn't foot the bill and the launch had to go back."
Ollie fired up to a white heat. "What sort of a way was
that for a man to treat his only son?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Awful!" commented Big John sarcastically.</p>

<p>"George told me how he was treated," went on Ollie,
failing to observe the sarcasm in Big John's voice, "and
I advised him to break away and show the old folks that
he wasn't going to let 'em tramp on him. He joined our
club and got to be one of the best card players we have."</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" expanded Big John. "I suppose his
folks were all cut up about that, eh?"</p>

<p>"I guess they were, only old Lorry took the wrong
way of showing it. What do you think he did?" flared
Ollie.</p>

<p>"I'm by. What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Why, he made arrangements to send George to one
of these military academies, that's nothing more or less
than a reform school. George came to me and told me
about it, and asked what he ought to do."</p>

<p>"And what did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"I told him to skip, and to take with him all the money
of his father's that he could get his hands on. Old Lorry
is a brute, and I didn't make any bones of telling George
what I thought."</p>

<p>"And George skipped, taking ten thousand dollars
from his father's safe," said Big John. "He went to
Chicago first, then bought a ticket to 'Frisco. When
he got there he had made friends with three men, and
one of those men was me. I'm a villain, Ollie, and ought
to be a horrible example to every young fellow who's got
sense enough to know right from wrong, and the minute
I learned Lorry had ten thousand dollars I planned
with my two pals, Kinky and Ross, to get it. We'd have
got away with it, too, on a boat to the Sandwich Islands,
where I could have bought a pineapple plantation and,
mebby, have lived honest for the rest of my life, but
something happened."</p>

<p>Big John looked through the bushes, out along the
road, and scowled blackly.</p>

<p>"What happened?" demanded Ollie.</p>

<p>"A chap named Joe McGlory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've heard of <i>him</i>," interrupted Ollie. "He's a cousin
of George's, and lives in Arizona. A cowboy and a
rowdy&mdash;nothing refined or genteel in his make up. Go
on."</p>

<p>"Well, McGlory got a message from young Lorry's
father asking him to go to 'Frisco and hunt for George.
McGlory went, but he'd never have found George in a
thousand years if it hadn't been for some one else who
butted into the game."</p>

<p>Big John scowled again, this time more fiercely than
he had done before.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" queried Ollie.</p>

<p>"Hold your horses a minute," proceeded Big John.
"McGlory and this other fellow took after Kinky, Ross,
and me, and dropped on us like a thousand of brick.
My, oh, my! Say, that other lad was the clear quill, all
right. I've seen a good many likely younkers, but never
one to match him. I guess you'd call him a 'sissy,' seeing
as how he don't smoke, or drink, or gamble, but just
trains his muscle to keep in form and cultivates his brain
along the line of motors, gasoline motors. And muscle!
Son, that fellow's got a 'right' any man would be proud
to own, and what he don't know about chug-engines nobody
knows."</p>

<p>Ollie's upper lip curled.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in paragons," said he. "But what has
all this got to do with our being here?"</p>

<p>"I'm getting to that. With this young fellow's help,
McGlory got the ten thousand away from us; not only
that, but we had to get out of 'Frisco on the jump to
keep the law from layin' hold of us. But Big John
wasn't throwing his hands in the air, not as anybody
knows of. I knew what would happen. Young Lorry
would have to be brought back to Madison, and this
motor boy would have to help McGlory bring him back.
Also, the ten thousand dollars would be brought back&mdash;and
I was still yearnin' for that money and the pineapple
plantation. I had Ross dodge back to 'Frisco and
watch. When McGlory and the other chap took the cars
with Lorry, Ross was on the same train, but he had
changed himself so no one would have known him.
Ross is good at that sort of thing, and that's the reason
I made him do the shadowin'. Kinky and me hurried
right on to Madison, where I called on you and reminded
you of the way I'd once given you a tip on a hoss race
in New York and helped you win a thousand. You remembered
old times"&mdash;Big John grinned widely&mdash;"and
you wasn't leery of me."</p>

<p>"I always liked you, Big John," averred the misguided
youth, "because you're so free and easy."</p>

<p>"Thanks," was the dry response. "Well, to proceed,"
he went on, "Ross dropped in on Kinky and me, last
night, and said that young Lorry and t'other two hadn't
come to Madison, but had got off the train at Waunakee
and had gone to a little cabin on the bank of a creek that
empties into the Catfish. Ross hung around the cabin,
listenin', until he found out that one of the outfit was to
walk into Madison, this morning, to have a talk with
Mr. Lorry. I don't know what the talk's to be about,
but this motor boy must have something up his sleeve."
Big John gave an ill-omened grin. "As near as I can
find out from Ross," he continued, "this chug-engine
chap thinks he can make a man out o' Lorry&mdash;but he's
going about it a little different from what you did, Ollie.
Now, I don't care a whoop about anything but that
money, and I rather believe I've fixed things so the
motor boy won't have easy sailin' with Mr. Lorry. But
that's neither here nor there. I got you to bring me out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
here in your benzine buggy, this mornin', so I could lay
for the chap that goes into town and take the ten thousand.
After I get it, you're to take me to Dane, or Lodi,
or Barraboo, and leave me there. That'll settle the debt
you owe me on account of the tip I gave you on that
hoss race, see? Are you willin'?"</p>

<p>The sinister face of the youth glowed with a fierce
light.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to help you get away, Big John," he answered,
"and I'm even willing to help you get the money.
This motor boy you speak about is trying to undermine
my influence with George, and, by Jupiter, I won't have
it. I know what's the best thing for George."</p>

<p>"We won't talk about that part of it," said Big John,
who was a strange mixture of right principles and evil
actions, "because I might say something you wouldn't
like. As I was saying, I've got my heart set on an honest
life and a pineapple plantation, and ten thousand ain't
any more to Lorry, the millionaire, than ten cents is to
me. I'm going to get that money&mdash;and here's where I
turn the trick. You can go farther back into the bushes
and watch, for I don't need your help."</p>

<p>Unbuttoning his coat, Big John began unwrapping
coil after coil of light rope from around his waist. When
he was through he had a thirty-foot riata in his left hand
and was holding the noose in his right.</p>

<p>Ollie, who had never been the confederate of a man
before in such a rascally piece of work, stared with wide
eyes at Big John; then, before pushing farther back into
the brush, he turned his eyes down the wooded road.</p>

<p>A young fellow, lithely built, and with the grace and
freedom of movement that marks the perfect athlete, was
swinging toward the bend from the direction of Waunakee.</p>

<p>"Is that McGlory?" asked Ollie in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Nary it ain't McGlory," replied Big John, with a
snap of the jaws. "It's Matt King, otherwise Motor
Matt, and here's where he gets what's comin' for meddlin'
in affairs that's none of his business. Get back, I
tell you, and give me a free hand."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">INTO A NOOSE&mdash;AND OUT OF IT AGAIN.</p>


<p>Motor Matt, swinging along the road toward Madison,
that morning, was particularly light-hearted. He and
his new chum, Joe McGlory, had accomplished something
worth while; and whenever a young fellow does
that he is pretty sure to be on good terms with himself.</p>

<p>The long railroad journey from San Francisco to a
point within a few miles of Madison had been safely accomplished.
Young Lorry had not been a willing traveler,
at first, but Matt had gradually won him over by
suggesting a plan which carried an appeal to Lorry's
heart. This plan had to do with the three boys leaving
the train at Waunakee, taking to the little cabin in the
woods, and then Lorry and McGlory staying there while
Matt went on to the city for a talk with the elder Lorry
and to deliver the ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Motor Matt and McGlory had had some exciting experiences
with Big John and his two pals, Kinky and
Ross, but those experiences had been passed through
safely, and the end of the journey, if not of Matt's work,
was in sight.</p>

<p>Matt had faith to believe that there was "good stuff"
in George Lorry. The boy had fled from Madison, and
had committed a dishonest act before doing so. Having
far and away too much pride for his own good, the
thought of being brought back, virtually under guard
and in disgrace, was more than he could bear. Matt
had tried to think of a plan for giving Lorry's return
a different look&mdash;hence the reason for McGlory and
Lorry remaining in the cabin while Matt went on to the
city.</p>

<p>The morning was fresh, the sun was bright, and the
clear weather seemed a good augury for what lay before.
Matt always made it a point to look on the bright side
of things, anyway.</p>

<p>Ahead of him lay a bend in the road. When he
rounded the bend he felt sure that he would be able to
catch a glimpse of the white dome of the capitol, and
from that point onward he would not be long in covering
the ground.</p>

<p>He halted abruptly just before he got to the bend.
The peculiar corrugated marks of automobile tires lay
under his eyes in the dust of the road. It wasn't so
much the marks themselves that claimed his attention as
the strange way they curved from the roadside and entered
the brush. Why should an automobile be taking
to the woods in that unaccountable fashion?</p>

<p>From ahead of him, around the bend, he heard a car.
The car was on the move, plainly enough, but the motor
was in distress, pounding badly; not only that, but there
was a smell of fried engine in the air, as though some
reckless driver were burning up his transmission.</p>

<p>Was the car Matt heard the one that had left its
tracks there by the roadside? He presumed that this
must be the case; so, instead of investigating the bushes,
he started to run around the bend. If he could help the
injured car, then perhaps the driver might give him a lift
the rest of the way into town.</p>

<p>As he started on, after a moment's pause, a sinuous,
snakelike thing leaped noiselessly from the bushes behind
him, unwound itself in the air, and a loop fell over
his head and dropped on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Motor Matt jumped as though he had been touched
with a live wire. He half turned and lifted his hands
to remove the coil, but it tightened before he could free
himself, and a rough jerk from behind landed him on
his back in the dust.</p>

<p>Matt had not been expecting such lawlessness on that
peaceable country road. Who was back of it, and what
was the purpose?</p>

<p>To escape, half-strangled as he was and with enemies
bearing down on him, was out of the question&mdash;at that
moment. The lad's resourcefulness suggested a trick,
whereby he hoped to gain time and discover a chance for
escape.</p>

<p>Although the fall backward had not injured him in the
least, yet he gave a groan, tried to lift himself, and then
fell back and lay still and silent.</p>

<p>In his ears the pounding of the motor around the bend
continued to echo, but, from the noise, he could not discover
that the car was coming in his direction. A quick
tramp of feet and a rustle of bushes were heard, and two
figures bounded to his side. One of the figures was that
of a man, and the other of a well-dressed, dissipated-looking
youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt, peering from half-closed eyes, could scarcely restrain
an exclamation at sight of the man. When he
had seen the man last, in San Francisco Bay, he had
worn a red beard. Although the beard was gone, Matt
recognized the scoundrel instantly&mdash;and the mole served
to make his identification complete.</p>

<p>"Confound it, John!" grumbled the youth, "<i>now</i> what
have you done? If he's badly hurt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Big John laughed.</p>

<p>"Hurt! Motor Matt badly hurt by a little drop like
that! Why, he's tougher'n whalebone and you couldn't
damage him with a sledge hammer. He's just stunned
and strangled, that's all. A good thing for me, too, because
he'll never know who roped him and we can get
away before he comes to himself. Pull out that noose
so he can breathe, Ollie. I'll get what I want out of the
younker's pocket and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's another machine!" Ollie muttered, staring
toward the bend as he was about to stoop over Matt
and release the noose.</p>

<p>"Just heard it?" answered Big John. "Well, don't
let it worry you. I've heard it for some time, and it's
coming into this road from a branch and is bound for
town. Look sharp, now, for we've got to hustle."</p>

<p>While Ollie, with trembling fingers, pulled out the loop
and drew it over Matt's head, Big John went down on
one knee to search his pockets.</p>

<p>Matt knew, then, what Big John was after. The rascal
was foolish enough to think Matt was carrying Lorry's
money in cash. This was not the case, for Matt
and McGlory had bought a draft in San Francisco.
Matt, however, did not intend to lose even the draft.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and most unexpectedly, he became very
much alive. With a quick move he hoisted himself upward,
catching Ollie by the shoulders and hurling him,
with terrific force, against Big John.</p>

<p>Both the youth and the man were caught at a disadvantage.
Ollie gave a startled cry as he carromed
against Big John, and the latter, as he staggered back,
said something more forcible than polite.</p>

<p>As for Matt, if he had any comments to make, he preferred
to send them by mail. Without hesitating an instant,
he took to his heels and tore around the bend.</p>

<p>He could see the dome of the capitol, far off and embowered
by trees, but he was thinking more, at that moment,
of the other car than he was of the capitol.</p>

<p>A hundred yards ahead was another road, coming
from the timber into the one he was following. The moment
Matt raced around the bend a swagger little runabout
was jumping from one road into the other.</p>

<p>The car was not <i>headed</i> toward Madison, although it
was proceeding in that direction. It was on the reverse
gear, and a young woman in the driver's seat was craning
her head around in order to see the way and do the
guiding.</p>

<p>There was only the young woman in the car, and Matt,
in spite of his dangerous situation, felt a distinct sense
of disappointment. He had been hoping to meet a man,
in that emergency, and now to meet a young woman&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But he had no time to waste in vain regrets. A look
over his shoulder showed him Big John hurrying after
him at top speed.</p>

<p>Matt knew that Big John was one of those lawless
persons who carry weapons in their hip pockets, and, although
Matt's legs could outdistance Big John's, the
young motorist would hardly be able to keep ahead of a
bullet.</p>

<p>But Big John held his hand and determined to trust
to his sprinting ability. To use a revolver would, perhaps,
have carried the matter farther than he wanted to
see it go.</p>

<p>Besides, Ollie was cranking up the big car and making
ready to bring it along in pursuit.</p>

<p>The smell of sizzling engine became stronger as Matt
drew closer to the runabout. The girl, with a very white
face, had turned in her seat and was staring toward
Matt with startled eyes. At the same moment she had
brought the car to a stop.</p>

<p>Big John, on seeing Matt draw abreast of the runabout,
halted and looked around for Ollie and the touring
car.</p>

<p>"Will you give me a ride into Madison?" Matt asked
of the girl, as respectfully as he could in the circumstances.</p>

<p>"What's&mdash;what's the matter?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"That fellow, back there, tried to rob me. I don't
think he will follow me far, on a public highway in broad
daylight&mdash;if you will let me ride in the runabout."</p>

<p>"But the bearings are chewed up!" cried the girl; "I'm
going home on the reverse."</p>

<p>"Take the other seat, please," said Matt. "I know
something about motors, and perhaps I can handle the
car so as to get more speed out of it with less rack on the
engine."</p>

<p>Without a word the girl changed to the other seat and
Matt leaped into the car beside her.</p>

<p>The next moment he had advanced the spark, thrown
in the high-speed clutch, and they were shooting down a
long slope.</p>

<p>Matt's eyes were behind, and the girl's in front of her.</p>

<p>"Oh, hurry, hurry!" she cried, in a frightened voice.
"They've got a big touring car, and I don't think anything
can keep them from overtaking us!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">GEORGE'S SISTER.</p>


<p>Matt threw a look over his shoulder. Big John was
just making a flying leap to the running board of a large
car. He fell aboard in a huddle, colliding with the dash
and striking violently against his young companion, who
was at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Matt was not able to look longer. By doing wonders
with the spark and the steering wheel, and by ignoring
the bubbling in the radiator and the pounding of the engine,
he nursed the runabout along at a good rate of
speed. A low hill was before them, and it came near
killing the car, but when they had reached the crest and
were ready for the descent on the other side, an exclamation
from the girl drew his attention.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "Is that other car close upon
us?"</p>

<p>"Something has gone wrong with the other automobile,"
was the answer. "When that man jumped aboard
he must have injured something."</p>

<p>Matt looked around again. Big John and his companion
were on the ground, looking over their car and
trying to locate the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for those fellows that the car went
wrong," said he. "In their excitement they might have
done something that would have got them both into
trouble. We'll go on for a little way and then I'll have
a look at the runabout and see if I can't fix it up so we
can run headfirst, like every respectable automobile ought
to run."</p>

<p>They coasted down the hill, and the tired and much
abused motor must have appreciated the rest.</p>

<p>"Is this your car?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply. "I don't think you can fix it,
for I've stripped the gear."</p>

<p>"I'll look at it, anyway, if you don't mind, just as soon
as we get to the bottom of this slope. I've had a lot of
experience with motors."</p>

<p>"You say that man tried to rob you?" queried the girl.</p>

<p>"That's the way it looked to me, but it seemed like
an audacious thing to attempt so near a big city like
Madison. You see, I was walking into town, and back
there at the bend in the road some one threw a rope and
I got tangled in the noose and thrown off my feet. I
managed to get away, though, and the man took after
me. If it hadn't been for you, that other car might have
overhauled me. I'm much obliged to you, miss."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I was able to help you," was the quiet reply.
"As you say, it is strange any one should try to
commit a robbery, in broad daylight, so close to the city.
And on a public highway, too!"</p>

<p>By then they were at the foot of the slope and Matt
brought the car to a halt. Here he got out and turned
to the girl.</p>

<p>"If you'll jump down for a minute," said he, "I'll give
that transmission a sizing and see if I can do anything
with it."</p>

<p>"But won't the other car come?" she demurred.</p>

<p>"Those fellows will think better of it. If they hadn't
been excited they wouldn't have tried to chase me.
They've had time to cool off, now, and to think better of
what they're doing."</p>

<p>Matt helped the girl down, and, for the first time,
saw that she was very young and very pretty. There was
a familiar cast to her features, somehow, which aroused
his wonder. Was it possible that he had ever met her
before?</p>

<p>Without trying very hard to answer this mental question,
he stripped off the transmission cover and thrust a
hand inside.</p>

<p>The metal band encircling the low-gear drum had
sustained a fracture. It was made of bronze, and had
been slotted for convenience in lubricating, and the break
was through two of the slots.</p>

<p>"The low gear is chewed up," he remarked to the girl,
"and that part of the machine is permanently retired. I
guess we'll have to go into Madison on the reverse, and
it will be well to go slow so as not to overheat the engine.
We can take care of that, all right, if we stop occasionally
to cool off. How far are we from town, by the
way?"</p>

<p>"Not more than two miles from Sherman Avenue and
Lake Mendota."</p>

<p>"We'll get over that quick enough. You don't mind
my riding with you?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad to have you," was the smiling reply. "You'll
save me from twisting my head off and doing all the
work."</p>

<p>Matt, with his gray, earnest eyes and fine face, was a
well-favored lad, and it is not to be wondered at if the
girl was impressed.</p>

<p>"Are you a stranger in this part of the country?" the
girl inquired, when they were once more in their seats
and backing away in the direction of town.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "Never been in these parts before."</p>

<p>"You were walking into town, you say?"</p>

<p>The girl eyed his neat, trim figure with a certain
amount of surprise.</p>

<p>"I was," he answered, with a laugh, "but please don't
think I'm a tramp. I've a draft for ten thousand dollars
in my pocket&mdash;and tramps are not usually as well
fixed as that. The fellow who roped me must have
known about that ten thousand, and perhaps he was foolish
enough to think that I had it in cash."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand dollars!" murmured the girl. "That's
a lot of money."</p>

<p>Evidently it was not such a vast sum&mdash;to her. That
swagger little car, as Matt figured it, was given to her
for her very own, and she was wearing the latest thing
in automobile coats, hats, and gauntlets. The dust coat
had become parted at the throat and revealed a fraternity
pin set with a big diamond.</p>

<p>"After I take your car to the garage," said Matt,
"perhaps you could tell me where I can find Mr. Daniel
Lorry?"</p>

<p>The girl started.</p>

<p>"Why," she exclaimed, "if we get to the garage about
noon you will find dad in the house in the same yard.
He's my father. I'm Ethel Lorry."</p>

<p>"Great spark-plugs!" exclaimed Matt. "I guess this
is my lucky day, after all. You're George's sister, are
you?"</p>

<p>A cry escaped the girl, and she reached out to drop a
convulsive hand on Matt's arm.</p>

<p>"You know George?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I should say so!" returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" The girl was tremendously excited.
"Is he well? Has he come back from San Francisco?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Lorry, he is back from San Francisco,
and he's feeling tiptop. But he didn't want to come to
Madison just yet. I left him not more than an hour ago.
His cousin, Joe McGlory, is with him."</p>

<p>"But why didn't he want to come home?" cried the
girl, with vague alarm in her voice.</p>

<p>"I'm to see your father and tell him about that. That's
what I was coming to town for."</p>

<p>The girl suddenly whitened, a frightened look arose in
her eyes, and she drew as far away from Matt as she
could.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Miss Lorry?" Matt asked.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;can it be that you are the young man called
Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm called. My real name is King, you
know, Matt King, but I'm always doing something with
motors and that's why they call me Motor Matt."</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a space. Her face continued
white, and she seemed to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p>"I think, Motor Matt," she said finally, in a strained
voice, "that you'd better get out of the car and let me
run it back to Madison alone."</p>

<p>Matt was "stumped." For a moment, so great was his
astonishment, he could not do a thing but stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "I want to see your father;
that's why I'm going into town this morning."</p>

<p>"I think it will be better for you if you don't see him."</p>

<p>Matt's bewilderment continued to increase.</p>

<p>"I've got ten thousand dollars for him, and also a message
from George," he managed to articulate.</p>

<p>"You can give me the money and the message, Mr.
Motor Matt," was the terse reply, "and I will see that
they are delivered."</p>

<p>Matt halted the car&mdash;it was time to cool off the engine
a little, anyway&mdash;and straightened in his seat.</p>

<p>"I am a friend of your brother's," he observed, "and
Joe McGlory will tell you what I have tried to do for
him. Your father sent a telegram to San Francisco asking
McGlory to have me come with him and George, if
possible. Now, at a good deal of inconvenience and expense
to myself, I have come&mdash;and why shouldn't I see
your father?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered Miss Lorry steadily, "he has recently
heard something about you that&mdash;that is not to
your credit. If you insist on seeing him, he might&mdash;he
might have you arrested."</p>

<p>If Matt was "stumped" before, he was staggered now.
Arrested! George Lorry's father might have him arrested!
And for what? For helping George recover the
ten thousand dollars, and for helping to bring George
back to Madison?</p>

<p>"There's a big mistake, somewhere," muttered Matt.</p>

<p>"You'll not go on?" queried Miss Lorry.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> go on," Matt returned firmly. "But I'll get
out of the car and walk, if you want it that way, Miss
Lorry. I can't give the money to you, or the message,
either. As I say, there's a mistake, and I must see your
father and explain away the bad impression he has of
me. Certainly he didn't get that from Joe McGlory."</p>

<p>"I don't know who told him what he knows," went on
the girl, "and I don't know <i>what</i> he knows, but he's
very much incensed against you, Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"I'll know why, before I'm many hours older," and
Matt got up to leave the car.</p>

<p>Once more the girl caught his arm.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you show that sort of spirit," said she. "If
you are really determined to see dad, and have a talk
with him, then that proves on the face of it that there
must be some mistake. Please stay and take the car into
town for me!"</p>

<p>Without a word, but with his mind working hard to
evolve some clue to this puzzling situation, Matt dropped
back in the driver's seat. He threw in the switch, and
the gas in the cylinders took the spark. But it was a
silent ride that he and Miss Lorry had during the rest
of the time they were backing into town.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE "JUMP SPARK."</p>


<p>Into the grounds of one of the finest homes on "Fourth
Lake Ridge," otherwise known as "Aristocracy Hill,"
Matt backed the little runabout. A brick-paved roadway,
overarched with trees, led from the front of the premises
to the neat garage in the rear.</p>

<p>A middle-aged gentleman, stout of build and with a
florid face, was sitting on the veranda of the house.
The runabout, worrying backward up the street and into
the yard, was an astonishing sight. The middle-aged
gentleman leaned against the rail and stared; then, waving
a newspaper which he held in his hand, he shouted
something and hurried down the steps and toward the
driveway.</p>

<p>"Dad!" murmured Miss Lorry, with an apprehensive
glance at Matt.</p>

<p>A man&mdash;probably the Lorry chauffeur&mdash;appeared in
the open door of the garage and stared at the runabout
in open-mouthed amazement.</p>

<p>Matt brought the car to a stop, and Mr. Lorry came
puffing up alongside.</p>

<p>"What in the world's the matter, Ethel?" he demanded,
his eyes swerving from his daughter to Matt.</p>

<p>"I smashed the low gear, dad, and had to come in on
the reverse," Miss Lorry answered. "I was just coming
into the Waunakee road, two or three miles the other
side of Maple Bluff, when the gear went wrong."</p>

<p>Mr. Lorry's eyes continued to rest on Matt, and they
were becoming uncomfortably inquisitive. He was wondering,
no doubt, who Matt was, how he came to be in
the car, and why his daughter did not introduce him.</p>

<p>"Call Gus," went on Miss Lorry, jumping lightly out
of the car, "and have him run <i>Dandy</i> into the garage.
Gus will know what to send for in order to make the
runabout as good as new again."</p>

<p>Without waiting to speak further, the girl whirled
about and ran into the house. Mr. Lorry stared after
her, and then turned to give Matt another look.</p>

<p>"Are you a chauffeur?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have been&mdash;a racing chauffeur," Matt answered,
springing to the ground, "but I haven't been driving a
car for some time."</p>

<p>"You helped my daughter&mdash;that much is plain, even
though I <i>have</i> been left in the dark on several other
points."</p>

<p>"I was coming into town along the Waunakee road,"
Matt went on, "to see you."</p>

<p>"To see me?" Mr. Lorry's interest visibly increased.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, on very important business. I happened to
meet Miss Lorry and she kindly gave me a ride into
town. The least I could do was to run her machine for
her."</p>

<p>"Did you know Miss Lorry?"</p>

<p>"Not until she told me who she was."</p>

<p>"Quite a coincidence that you should meet her, when
you were coming into town to see her father. But come
up on the veranda&mdash;we'll be more comfortable there."
Mr. Lorry turned toward the garage. "The runabout's
in trouble, Gus," he called. "Take it into the garage,
see what it needs, then order whatever's necessary. This
way, sir," he added to Matt.</p>

<p>While Gus removed the runabout to the garage, Matt
followed Mr. Lorry up the steps to the veranda and
seated himself in a chair.</p>

<p>"I don't remember ever seeing you before," remarked
Mr. Lorry as he sat down close to Matt, picked up a fan,
and began stirring the air in front of his perspiring face.
"But I'm obliged to you for giving Ethel a helping hand.
I'm worried to death every time she's out with <i>Dandy</i>.
It wasn't more than a week ago that she came near going
over a bluff at McBride's Point."</p>

<p>Matt lost no time in plunging into his business. Drawing
the draft from his pocket, he handed it to Mr. Lorry.</p>

<p>"Part of my work," said he, "is to give you that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lorry stared at the draft and opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand dollars!" he exclaimed, "and it's made
payable to Joseph McGlory."</p>

<p>"On the back, sir, you will see that Joe had indorsed
it over to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Lorry turned over the oblong slip of paper; then,
suddenly, an idea darted through his mind and he stiffened
in his chair.</p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;is this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the money George took when he left Madison,"
said Matt, dropping his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Lorry's face hardened.</p>

<p>"Then," said he raspingly, "inasmuch as you're not
McGlory, I suppose you're that young rascal, Matt
King, better known as Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"My name is Matt King, sir," answered Matt, "and
you have no right to refer to me as a rascal."</p>

<p>"I have, by gad," exploded Mr. Lorry, "and a very
good right! I've heard about you, sir. You're the lad
who was hand-and-glove with the three villains who made
George so much trouble on account of this money. I
wonder that you have the face to show yourself to me.
Do you know what I could do with you?"</p>

<p>A hostile red had leaped into Mr. Lorry's face. As
Matt sat back and looked at him, he likened his anger to
a "jump spark."</p>

<p>The "make and break" system of ignition, while electrically
simple, is complicated mechanically. The "jump
spark" system, on the other hand, while complicated
electrically is mechanically very simple.</p>

<p>A simple error of some sort lay back of Mr. Lorry's
anger, but it found vent in mighty puzzling expressions.</p>

<p>"Who is your authority for the statement that I was
hand-and-glove with the three men who robbed George?"
asked Matt calmly.</p>

<p>"I decline to quote anybody."</p>

<p>"You can ask McGlory, or George, about me," proceeded
Matt, "and I think they will tell you that if it
hadn't been for me that money would never have been
recovered."</p>

<p>"You have pulled the wool over McGlory's eyes, and
over George's, too. But where's my son? Why didn't
he bring this money to me himself? Why was it necessary
for him to send it at the hands of a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Your son is a few miles out of town. He did not
leave San Francisco willingly, and it was only by promising
him that we would not take him directly into Madison
that we got his consent to come with us."</p>

<p>"A fine lay-out!" muttered Mr. Lorry. "The boy's got
to come here, sooner or later, and what is he to gain by
delaying the matter? Can't he realize how worried all of
us are?"</p>

<p>"He feels the disgrace of his position very keenly, Mr.
Lorry."</p>

<p>"Bosh! Not much of what he's done is known to outsiders,
and those who know, or think they know, anything
about it, will forget the whole business within a
week after George gets back."</p>

<p>"Are you going to send George to military school,
Mr. Lorry?"</p>

<p>At that the "jump spark" seemed about to set off an
explosion. Mr. Lorry twisted angrily in his chair.</p>

<p>"What business is it of yours, young man?" he
snapped. "That boy has got to realize that he isn't of
age yet, and I'm not going to let him run wild and bring
disgrace on himself, and on me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lorry," said Matt earnestly, "I have tried to be
a good friend to your son, and it was your request, contained
in the telegram you sent to San Francisco, that
I come with him and McGlory, that brought me here. I
won't tell you what I have done&mdash;I will leave that to
George and his cousin&mdash;but I will tell you, as plainly as
I can, that George is just now in a place where he must
be treated with consideration. One false move would
prove his ruin, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By gad," interrupted Mr. Lorry, "do you mean to
sit there and lecture <i>me</i>? Why, I'm old enough to be
your father! Such impudence as that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," protested Matt, "I'm not impudent. I know
George pretty well, and I want to do what I can for him.
He's got lots of pride, and he had his heart set on getting
a power-boat that would make a good showing in the
coming race of the Winnequa Yacht Club. He had
talked about what he was going to do to members of the
club, and when he ordered that boat and you refused to
pay for it and let it be sent back to the builders, the blow
to his pride started him off on the wrong course."</p>

<p>"A five-thousand-dollar boat, by gad!" growled Mr.
Lorry. "His whims were getting too confoundedly expensive.
If his pride is going to suffer every time I put
my foot down on such a piece of folly, then he'll have to
pocket his pride. I'm his father, and I guess he'll have
to toe the mark for me for a while yet."</p>

<p>"There's a way to make George the happiest fellow in
Madison, Mr. Lorry," Matt went on, "and it won't cost
you more than two hundred and fifty or three hundred
dollars. I know a good deal about motors, and I'll help
George fix up a boat that will win a prize in that yacht
club race&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a cent more will he get from me!" stormed Mr.
Lorry. "He'll come back here, and he'll go to that military
school, and if what you call his 'pride' keeps him
from being a dutiful son, then his pride will be broken.
Where is he? Where did you leave him?"</p>

<p>"If you go out to where he is now, without first giving
him a chance to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Lorry leaned forward and shook a finger in Matt's
face.</p>

<p>"If you want to keep yourself out of trouble, my lad,
you'll tell me where that boy is, and no more ifs nor
ands about it."</p>

<p>Matt got up slowly. He was white, but none the less
determined.</p>

<p>"I am George's friend, Mr. Lorry," said he, "and I
had to promise him that I would help him do certain
things here in Madison in order to get him safely back
from the West. If I tell you where he is, while you
feel as you do toward him, I would be breaking my
promise. He is well, and he will be here in a few days.
As for the rest, if you want to make trouble for me,
why, go ahead."</p>

<p>Intensely disappointed with the result of his interview,
Matt passed down the steps and toward the street.
Mr. Lorry gasped wrathfully and watched as he left the
yard, but he made no attempt to interfere with him.</p>

<p>Matt was hardly out of sight, however, before he ran
into the house and began using the telephone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BY EXPRESS, CHARGES COLLECT.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was surprised enough, as he left the Lorry
mansion, and his indignation equaled his surprise.</p>

<p>Who could possibly have furnished Lorry with the
information on which he had based his remarkable conclusions?
Certainly his attitude had changed most decidedly
since he had sent his telegram to 'Frisco requesting
that Matt accompany McGlory in bringing George
home to Madison.</p>

<p>Matt, as he descended the ridge and proceeded toward
the capitol and the main part of the town, could think of
only one possible cause for Mr. Lorry's actions. Big
John must be in some way mixed up in it.</p>

<p>The knowledge that Big John was in that part of the
country had come like a thunderbolt to Matt. The last
the king of the motor boys had heard of Big John, he and
his two pals, Kinky and Ross, were getting out of California
by way of Sausalito. A bolt from the blue could
not have been more astounding than the discovery of Big
John attempting a robbery there on the Waunakee road.</p>

<p>Why had Big John come to Madison? And how had
he known that Matt was going to pass that particular
point on the Waunakee road that morning?</p>

<p>No doubt Big John's eastern trip had been inspired by
the ten thousand dollars of Lorry's. The rascal had been
lured to Wisconsin by the hope of recovering the money.
This seemed clear enough&mdash;much clearer than the method
by which Big John had learned that Matt was to go
over the Waunakee road that morning, on foot.</p>

<p>Yes, Big John must have been back of that misinformation
which Mr. Lorry had accepted as a true statement
of facts. But it was odd how the scoundrel had
been able to influence Mr. Lorry as he had.</p>

<p>Motor Matt felt that he was embarked on a struggle
for the right, and that he must go on with the battle in
spite of his enemies. George Lorry's whole future might
hang on the result of that fight.</p>

<p>Had Matt told Mr. Lorry where McGlory and George
were waiting, the millionaire would certainly have proceeded
to the place and attempted to bring George in to
Madison. This would have led George to believe that
Matt had broken faith with him, and the lad would have
bolted for parts unknown.</p>

<p>George had been allowed to have his way for so long
that, when his father took another tack and resolved to
be severe with him, the lad had thought himself abused
and imposed upon. George was a spoiled youth, but Matt
believed that he had the right material in him and would
prove a credit to his people if given the proper kind of a
chance. Just as surely, too, he would go down to ruin
and disgrace if the wrong move was made at that critical
time.</p>

<p>Lorry, senior's, obstinate determination to send George
to the military school would be a step in the wrong direction.
By paying out a little money for a motor launch,
Mr. Lorry would have gone far toward healing the breach
between him and his son, and would have paved the way
for a perfect understanding. This affair of the launch
looked like a trifling matter, but no one but Matt and
McGlory knew how much it meant to George.</p>

<p>When Matt reached the main part of the city his study
of the situation had convinced him that he was doing exactly
right. What his next step was to be he hardly
knew. He hated to go back and tell George of his father's
uncompromising attitude, and yet he felt the need
of a talk with McGlory in order to lay future plans.</p>

<p>It was about one o'clock, and Matt went into a restaurant
and ate his dinner. From there he went to the post
office to see if any mail had followed him from San
Francisco.</p>

<p>No mail had reached him from the West, but there was
a postal card, posted that morning in Madison, which informed
Matt that a certain express company had received,
and was holding at his risk, a crated power boat
on which there was a charge, for <i>transportation alone</i>, of
$262.50.</p>

<p>When Matt read the postal card he was positive there
was some mistake, and that it had been given to the
wrong person. The card was addressed, plainly enough,
to "Matt King, otherwise Motor Matt," but the king of
the motor boys was not expecting a launch, had not ordered
one, and was not intending to turn over $262.50
to the express company on what was manifestly an error.</p>

<p>He was on the point of handing the card back to the
man at the post-office window, with the information that
the card could not be for him, when he suddenly changed
his mind and decided to go to the express company's
office and rectify the mistake at headquarters.</p>

<p>A little inquiry put him on the right road, and within
five minutes he was leaning over a counter at the express
office, showing the clerk the card and telling him the boat
must be for some other Matt King.</p>

<p>"There's no other Matt King in Madison," protested
the clerk, "and it's a cinch there's no other Motor Matt.
You're the fellow the boat is for."</p>

<p>"But that charge!" exclaimed Matt. "It can't be for
transportation alone. It must be a C. O. D. collection for
part of the price of the boat. I haven't bought any boat,
and am not expecting any one to send me a boat. I'm a
stranger here, and only reached Madison to-day."</p>

<p>"Can't help that. If you're Motor Matt the boat's for
you. If you refuse it we'll have to notify the shipper,
and if we can't get any satisfaction from the shipper, the
boat will have to be sold for the charges."</p>

<p>"Great spark-plugs!" muttered Matt. "Where's the
boat from?"</p>

<p>"San Francisco."</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys stared blankly at the clerk.</p>

<p>"From San Francisco, eh?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's all complete&mdash;an eighteen-footer, with
engine installed."</p>

<p>"Can&mdash;can I see it?"</p>

<p>"Come this way."</p>

<p>The clerk opened a gate at the end of the counter
and Matt walked through and into the storeroom. There
he saw the boat, securely crated. Between the bars of the
crate he read the name <i>Sprite</i>, lettered on the bow.</p>

<p>By that time the king of the motor boys was too far
gone for words. Leaning against the wall of the room,
he bent his head and drummed a tattoo on his brow with
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Who's the shipper?" he finally managed to ask.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether the way bill has it right or
not, but the name of the consignor is down as Ping
Pong. It reads like a joke. Eh?"</p>

<p>Matt left the room and retired to the other side of the
counter in the office.</p>

<p>There was no joke about it. "Ping Pong" might look
to the express agent like a fake name, but it was <i>bona fide</i>
for all that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Ping Pong was the name of a Chinese lad whom Matt
had befriended in San Francisco. The Celestial had won
the <i>Sprite</i> in a raffle, and had turned the boat over to
Matt on condition that Matt would allow Ping Pong to
work for him. Ping and the <i>Sprite</i> had disappeared
mysteriously before the young motorist left 'Frisco, and
that was the last seen of either the Chinaman or the boat
until now. And here the boat had turned up in that
Madison office of the express company with transportation
charges of $262.50 to be collected!</p>

<p>The idea of sending a power boat, engine and all, by
express, in a heavy crate, was a piece of folly of which
even a ten-year-old American boy would not have been
guilty. But Ping was a Chinaman, and probably he
thought Matt was a millionaire.</p>

<p>"Goin' to take it or leave it?" inquired the agent as
Matt walked back and forth across the office turning this
new development over in his mind. "The charges ain't
any more than what they always are&mdash;three times the
merchandise rate."</p>

<p>"I guess the charges are all right," said Matt humorously,
"for it's a long haul. And then, too, the crate, and
the engine, and the boat weigh up to beat the band."</p>

<p>"Going to take it?"</p>

<p>Matt's mind had been rapidly going over the points of
the case. Madison was surrounded by lakes, and motor-boating
was a hobby with a large number of the people.
By sending the <i>Sprite</i> to Matt, Ping had undoubtedly
determined that he should have the boat. The <i>Sprite</i>
was speedy&mdash;Matt had tried her out in San Francisco
Bay and knew that&mdash;and with some changes in the reversing
gear Matt believed she could show her heels to
anything from First Lake to Fourth. On such a showing,
the boat could undoubtedly be sold at a good price,
and while $262.50 was a big sum to pay out, just for express
charges, still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then Matt had another thought, and it was a "startler."
George wanted a motor boat for the race. The
<i>Sprite</i> wasn't a five-thousand-dollar "speeder," but she
could run like a streak with the right kind of a fellow at
the engine. Mr. Lorry had refused to help George to a
boat, and this unexpected arrival of the <i>Sprite</i> seemed
almost providential.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take the boat," said Matt, pushing a
hand into his pocket and stepping up to the counter.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"PICKEREL PETE."</p>


<p>By bringing the submarine boat <i>Grampus</i> safely
around South America the king of the motor boys had
made a good deal of money. Most of this he had invested
on the Pacific Slope, but he had more than enough
of the "ready" with him to settle the express charges
and to keep him afloat until George Lorry's affairs had
been put in proper shape.</p>

<p>Having paid over the money and signed the express
receipt, the question as to what should be done with the
<i>Sprite</i> presented itself.</p>

<p>"You can uncrate the boat in the storeroom, if you
want to," said the obliging clerk, "and then we'll have
her hauled down to the water for you."</p>

<p>"Much obliged," answered Matt. "I believe I'll take
off the crate and see how the boat has stood her long
overland journey."</p>

<p>The clerk furnished him with a hatchet, and Matt
threw off his coat and got busy. In an hour, the clean-cut
hull of the <i>Sprite</i> had emerged from a litter of boards
and old gunny sacks. An examination showed that both
hull and machinery were in as good condition as ever.</p>

<p>While Matt was working he had noticed a map of
Madison hanging from the storeroom wall. The map
gave a very clear idea of Lakes Monona and Mendota,
between which lay the long and narrow city.</p>

<p>One of the express company's drivers had come into
the storeroom and was looking over the <i>Sprite</i> with an
air of deep interest.</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me something about this map,
neighbor," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Ask me anything you want to," was the cheerful response.
"I was born and raised here and I know the
place pretty well."</p>

<p>"What's this?" Matt inquired, laying a finger on a
certain part of the diagram.</p>

<p>"That's the Yahara River, sometimes called the 'Catfish.'
It's been straightened into a canal, and connects
Third and Fourth Lakes. Monona is Third, and Mendota
is Fourth. There's locks at the Mendota end."</p>

<p>"And what's the other river coming into Mendota
Lake on the side across from the city?"</p>

<p>"The Yahara again."</p>

<p>"Then, if this boat was launched in Lake Monona, it
could enter the Canal over by Winnequa, cross into
Mendota Lake, and proceed up the Yahara?"</p>

<p>"She could, sure. Lots of boats do that."</p>

<p>"Here's a creek entering the Yahara. Is that navigable
for a boat drawing two or three feet of water?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. I guess a small boat could get up the creek
a ways."</p>

<p>As Matt figured it, the cabin where he had left McGlory
and George was on the creek. Why couldn't he
get the <i>Sprite</i> afloat and proceed by water to the cabin?</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about these lakes," went on
Matt, "but I'd like to get some one who knows them
and make a little cruise."</p>

<p>"Fourth Lake is mighty treacherous. Whenever
there's a west wind she kicks up a big sea, and a lot
of boats have come to grief on the rocks of Maple Bluff.
That's here&mdash;that piece of land running out into the
water, over where they've made a park. It used to be
called McBride's Point. A mile across from the bluff
is Governor's Island. The insane asylum is near the
island. If you want to put your boat in Fourth Lake,
why don't you launch it there instead of taking it to
Third Lake?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to try her out with a little longer cruise
than just across Fourth Lake. Do you know of any
one I could get to pilot me around?"</p>

<p>"H'm!" murmured the driver thoughtfully. Presently
his face brightened. "Any objection to color?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, how'd a colored boy do? I know of one that's
right to home on the lakes, and he's a character, you
bet. His name's Pickerel Pete; that's all he's got, just
Pickerel Pete."</p>

<p>"He'll do," said Matt. "How can I get hold of Pickerel
Pete?"</p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do; I'll get hold of him for you.
When you going to put that boat in the water?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right away."</p>

<p>"'Course we got to deliver it for you. I'll have some
of the boys help me get it on the dray, and on the way
down to the lake I'll pick up Pete. You don't need to
wait here. In half an hour you go down King Street to
Wilson. There's a lot of landings and boathouses
t'other side the railroad depot. If we ain't there when
you reach the place, you wait, and we'll show up pretty
soon afterward."</p>

<p>"That's mighty good of you," said Matt. "You'll be
careful of the boat, will you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, you bet. No harm'll happen to her. We got
a special dray for movin' boats like that."</p>

<p>Matt went to the capitol grounds and sat down on a
bench. For half or three-quarters of an hour he was
there, thinking of George and the unsatisfactory state his
affairs had drifted into.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys did not want to appear
to be helping George to dodge his father's authority, but
he knew that the elder Lorry would not have taken the
stand he did if he had not acquired a whole lot of misinformation.
The thing for Matt to do was to get back
to George and McGlory, tell them exactly what had
taken place, and then ask them for suggestions as to the
next move.</p>

<p>On the way down King Street, Matt stopped at a
store and bought a supply of gasoline, oil, and cotton
waste. Not having a hydrometer, he tested the gasoline
as well as he could by other means, and convinced himself
that it was, as the dealer assured him, the "right
stuff."</p>

<p>Matt rode down to the lake with the expressman who
took his supplies, and when he got there he found the
<i>Sprite</i> in the water, moored to a small pier. The express
driver, and those who had helped him with the boat, were
gone. The only person in the vicinity of the launch was
a barefooted little darky. He sat on the pier, absorbed
in throwing a couple of dice.</p>

<p>"Come seben, 'leben, come seben, 'leben," he was saying,
as the small cubes rattled on the boards.</p>

<p>"Pickerel Pete!" called Matt.</p>

<p>The little negro jumped as though a bomb had exploded
under him.</p>

<p>"Yassuh, yassuh, dat's me," he answered, grabbing up
the dice and shoving them into a pocket of his ragged
trousers.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Pete, and give us a hand with this
gasoline and stuff."</p>

<p>"On de hop."</p>

<p>The gasoline was emptied into the tanks and the oil
cups filled. After that Matt went over the machinery,
carefully examining the ignition and all connections.</p>

<p>Pickerel Pete helped him intelligently.</p>

<p>"Yo's de fellah whut's a-wantin' tuh hiah me?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matt, highly pleased with the way Pete
divined whatever he wanted and handed it over to him
from the tool kit. "Do you know anything about a
motor boat, Pete?"</p>

<p>"Ah's done steered heaps o' boats froo dese yer lakes,
boss," grinned the moke, "an' Ah reckons Ah knows de
spa'k plug f'om de propellah."</p>

<p>"You know the lakes, too?"</p>

<p>"Hones' tuh goodness, boss, Ah could go froo all de
lakes f'om First tuh Fo'th, en cleah down de Rock Rivah,
wif mah eyes shut. Ah'm er phenomegon."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Phenomegon. Doan' you-all know whut a phenomegon
is?"</p>

<p>"You mean a phenomenon, I guess."</p>

<p>"Ah reckons Ah knows whut Ah means," answered
Pete, with sudden dignity.</p>

<p>"You've mixed phenomenon and paragon, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah ain't mixed nuffin. Ef you-all thinks Ah'm er
ignorampus, den Ah 'lows Ah ain't de fellah you wants
tuh hiah."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are, Pete&mdash;you're just the fellow."</p>

<p>"How much does Ah git?"</p>

<p>"Two dollars a day. There's pay for your first day's
work."</p>

<p>Pete almost fell out of the boat. Fifty cents a day was
the most he had ever received.</p>

<p>"Does yo' think yo' kin stand dat, boss?" he inquired.
"Ah'd hate mahse'f tuh def ef Ah thought Ah was er
strainin' yo' financibility."</p>

<p>"I guess it won't be much of a wrench to give you
a couple of dollars a day," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Den yo's bought me. By golly, dis is de first time
Ah's evah had two whole dollahs knockin' togethah en
mah clothes since Ah was knee-high to a chickum.
Where you-all wants tuh go, boss?"</p>

<p>"I want to go into Fourth Lake through the canal,
then across Fourth and up the Catfish."</p>

<p>"Dat's easy. De Catfish runs f'om one lake tuh de
odder, intuh one en out ergin, cleah f'om Fo'th Lake tuh
First. Thutty miles you-all kin go in er boat, den intuh

<p>"They ought to have given you two medals, Pete."</p>

<p>"En it was er solid gol' medal, with er inscripshun
sayin' dat Pickerel Pete was gallywhoopus tuh dat extent.
Golly, but dat was er fine medal! It was as big
erroun' as er fryin' pan."</p>

<p>"Must have bothered you some to tote it."</p>

<p>"Sold it fo' fo' dollahs en fo'ty cents, en dey kep' it in
de cap'tol fo' people tuh come in en look at. Yo's got er
pow'ful fine moke wo'kin' fo' yo', boss."</p>

<p>"Well, cast off, Pete, and we'll start. I'll do the steering,
and you can sit up front and tell me which way to
go."</p>

<p>Matt started the gasoline, switched on the spark, and
Pete gave the fly wheel a turn. One turn of the wheel
was enough to give them their first explosion, and the
<i>Sprite</i> shook herself together and started out into the
lake.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">GEORGE AND M'GLORY MISSING.</p>


<p>The hum of the motor was soothing to Matt's troubled
spirit, and even the kick of the wheel sent a joyous thrill
through his every nerve. There were clouds in the west,
and a promise of wind and rain in the air, but if there
was to be a storm it would not come before night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the <i>Sprite</i> would have ample time to nose her way up
the Catfish and into the creek.</p>

<p>It was surprising how quickly the kinks of fortune
straightened themselves out for Motor Matt whenever he
found himself in control of an explosive engine.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking behind the capitol as the <i>Sprite</i>
headed toward Winnequa on her way to the Canal. The
yellow rays pierced the gathering clouds, and Madison
peered from its enveloping greenery like a phantom city.</p>

<p>A number of fishermen were rowing, sailing, and motoring
home for supper, and they stared at the dashing
little <i>Sprite</i>, and some of them yelled a cheerful greeting
to the diminutive colored boy perched on the launch's
hood.</p>

<p>"Dat's de Gobernor ob Wisconsin," Pete gravely explained,
indicating a grizzled fisherman in one of the
boats. "Ah knows him as well as Ah knows anybody.
De fellah in dat rowboat wif de pipe is Honnerbull Tawm
Patterson, en he's done took me by de han' mo' times
dan Ah kin count. De lake is full ob notoribus pussuns
tuhnight, seems lak."</p>

<p>"Where's the Czar of Russia?" asked Matt soberly.</p>

<p>"Ah reckons he was too busy tuh come out tuhday,"
answered Pete. "Ah knows him, dough. Ah done took
him tuh a good fishin' place ovah by Picnic P'int las'
week."</p>

<p>They passed the canal and locks, swept into Fourth
Lake, and Pete lined out a westerly course that carried
the <i>Sprite</i> past the high bluffs of McBride's Point with
the buildings of the asylum in clear view.</p>

<p>Pete's chatter enlivened the trip wonderfully. The little
moke was a "notoribus" personage, to take his word
for it, and there were very few famous people whom
he had not shaken hands with or conducted around the
lakes. Matt was surprised to learn that he had dug bait
for Julius Csar and had shown Napoleon Bonaparte a
pickerel hole off Governor's Island.</p>

<p>The Catfish was comparatively easy for the <i>Sprite</i>, but
Whisky Creek&mdash;which, Pete said, was the particular
creek Matt was looking for&mdash;was too shoal. After they
had grounded twice, and backed clear with considerable
difficulty, Matt decided to tie up to a tree on the creek
bank and go on to the cabin on foot.</p>

<p>By then it was falling dark, and Matt wanted to cover
the remainder of his journey as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"Pete," said he, getting out on the creek bank, "I'm
going to leave you with the boat for a short time, while
I go up the creek."</p>

<p>Pete immediately had an attack of the "shakes."</p>

<p>"Golly, boss," he chattered, "Ah doan' lak de da'k
when Ah's erlone. Hit's spookerous, en white things
done trabbel erroun' lookin' fo' brack folks. Where you-all
gwine?"</p>

<p>"Not far. I ought to be back in an hour. You're not
afraid of spooks, are you, Pete? I should think a chap
who was the friend of so many illustrious people would
be above such foolishness."</p>

<p>The gathering wind sobbed through the trees, and
from somewhere a screech-owl tuned up in a most hair-raising
way.</p>

<p>"Br-r-r!" muttered Pete, hugging himself and dropping
into the bottom of the boat. "Ah ain't afraid, no,
sah," he declared plaintively. "Ah ain't afraid ob anythin'
dat walks. Hit's dem white ha'nts whut doan' walk,
er fly, but moves erlong in er glide, dat gits me a-goin'.
Mebby Ah better go along wif yo' en see dot yo' doan' git

<p>"I'll not get lost, Pete, and I don't want the <i>Sprite</i>
left alone."</p>

<p>"Yo'll be back in er houah, hones'?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Den hurry. Ef Ah was lef' in dishyer place twell
midnight Ah'd be skeered plumb intuh de 'sylum, sho' as
yo's bawn. Hurry up en git back, dat's all."</p>

<p>Pete cuddled up with his back against the stern thwart,
and Matt whirled away and vanished into the timber.</p>

<p>As Matt figured it, he was not more than a mile from
the cabin. He had landed on the side of the creek where
he knew the shack to be, and if he followed the little
water course he knew he would soon arrive at the place
where he had left George and McGlory.</p>

<p>The timber was broken into by fields of corn, and by
cleared pasture land. Matt pushed through the corn and
climbed pasture fences, and within half an hour came to
the end of his journey.</p>

<p>The cabin, nestling in a clump of oaks, seemed dark
and deserted. George had known of the cabin as a rendezvous,
in the fall, for duck hunters. It was a quiet
and obscure place, and answered admirably the requirements
of the boys while working out their plans in Lorry's
behalf.</p>

<p>As Matt drew closer to the hut the silence oppressed
him with a foreboding that something had gone wrong.
The door was open, and he stepped inside.</p>

<p>Still there was no sign of life about the place.</p>

<p>"McGlory!" he called; "George!"</p>

<p>His voice echoed weirdly through the one room of the
cabin, but brought no response.</p>

<p>Striking a match, he peered about him.</p>

<p>Empty! There was no one in the room.</p>

<p>The match flickered and dropped from Matt's fingers.
Groping his way to a bench, he sat down, alarmed and
bewildered.</p>

<p>What had become of McGlory and George? This was
the question he asked himself, and his mind framed a
dozen different answers, none of them satisfactory.</p>

<p>George was full of whims and unreasonable resolves.
Had he suddenly made up his mind that he could not
trust Matt to make peace with his father? Had he
broken away from McGlory, and had McGlory gone in
pursuit of him?</p>

<p>Or was the absence of the boys due to some move
against them on the part of Big John?</p>

<p>Or had they gone to some farmhouse after milk and
eggs, or to get a hot supper?</p>

<p>That George had not "bolted," Matt was almost sure.
Matt's plan for patching up a truce with the elder Lorry
had appealed to George too strongly for that.</p>

<p>As for Big John making George and McGlory any
trouble, that was possible, although not very probable.
Matt did not see how Big John could have any information
about the cabin.</p>

<p>And as for the boys visiting a neighboring farmhouse
to secure food, it was not in line with their plan for
either George or McGlory to show himself until their
schemes were further advanced.</p>

<p>Rations had been secured in Waunakee&mdash;cold rations,
but enough to last all three of the boys for two or three
days.</p>

<p>Giving over his bootless reflections, Matt lighted another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
match, hunted up a candle, and soon had a more
dependable glow in the room.</p>

<p>A brief search showed him that George's suit case,
McGlory's carpetbag, and his own satchel were missing.
This was a staggering discovery. It meant, if it meant
anything, that the two boys had left and did not intend to
return.</p>

<p>They would hardly go away, it seemed to Matt, without
leaving some clue as to their whereabouts, and the
cause that had led them to make such a decided change
in the general plans. George and McGlory understood
that Matt was to return as soon as he had talked with
Mr. Lorry.</p>

<p>Matt had expected to get back to the cabin early in the
afternoon. Had his failure to return alarmed the two
boys?</p>

<p>Matt hunted high and low for some scrap of writing
which would let in a little light on the situation, but he
could find none.</p>

<p>The rations brought from Waunakee had vanished
along with the luggage&mdash;another fact that indicated a
permanent departure on the part of the two lads.</p>

<p>"Here's a go!" muttered Matt, leaning perplexedly in
the open door of the cabin. "About all George and McGlory
left behind them was that piece of candle. They
might, at least, have tipped me off regarding their intentions,
I should think. All sorts of things are liable
to happen to a fellow when he's trying to do the right
thing by another chap who's too proud and weak-kneed
to put himself company-front with his responsibilities.
But then, George is an odd stick. He can't be judged
by any of the usual standards, and I'm pretty sure that
if he's handled right, he'll come out all right. One or
the other of them will certainly come back here. I'll return
to the mouth of the creek, get Pete, and we'll bunk
down in the cabin. It's the only thing to be done."</p>

<p>Perplexed as he was, Matt neglected to put out the
candle before starting on his return to the Catfish. On a
corner shelf, the feeble gleam sputtered and flickered in
the draft that came through the open door.</p>

<p>Matt hastened his steps on the return journey to the
<i>Sprite</i>. The clouds were slowly mounting and blotting
out the stars, intensifying the darkness.</p>

<p>As he came close to the bank where the launch was
moored he experienced a feeling of relief when he saw
the boat riding to her painter just as she had been left.</p>

<p>The <i>Sprite</i> resembled a black blot on the water. The
bank was rather high, at that point, and its shadow covered
the boat.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pete!" called Matt.</p>

<p>There was no answer to the call, and Matt began to
think that Pete had vanished, as well as George and McGlory.</p>

<p>"Pete!" Matt cried in a louder tone.</p>

<p>"Yassuh, yassuh," came the answer from below, and
Matt's apprehension suddenly subsided.</p>

<p>"Come up here, Pete," Matt went on. "We're going
to spend the night up the creek. I guess the <i>Sprite</i> will
be safe enough. There's a lantern in the port locker,
amidships. Bring it up with you."</p>

<p>Matt could see only the blurred outline of a human
form moving around in the boat. He heard the lid of the
locker as it was lifted.</p>

<p>"Ah kain't find dat lantern," came from the boat.</p>

<p>"I'll get it," said Matt.</p>

<p>The next moment he had climbed into the launch.
Hardly had his feet found firm foothold when he was
seized and flung roughly backward. Two pairs of hands
held him, and a hoarse, mocking laugh echoed in his ears.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SETTING A SNARE.</p>


<p>Pickerel Pete did not feel overloaded with responsibility.
Two dollars a day was a princely wage, but there
were things he would not do even for that immense sum.
He would try to stay with the boat for an hour, in spite
of the owls and the queer crooning of the wind in the
trees, but if he saw a "ha'nt," he'd resign his job, right
then and there, and leave the <i>Sprite</i> to take care of herself.
Anyhow, he had two dollars. The fact that his
services had been paid for until afternoon of the following
day did not enter seriously into his calculations.</p>

<p>"Wisht de screech-owls would stop dat 'ar screechin',"
muttered the darky, "an' I wisht de win' would stop dat
ar' groanin' in de trees. Dishyer's jest de time fer spookerous
doin's, an' I'd radder be home in mah baid wif mah
head kivered, so'st&mdash;&mdash; Golly, whut's dat?"</p>

<p>Something fluttered among the tree branches overhanging
the water, farther along the creek. It may have
been an owl, or some other bird, changing its roosting
place, but Pete's fears magnified the cause into something
connected with the "ha'nts."</p>

<p>Crouching in the boat's bottom, he stared through the
darkness and held his breath. The fluttering had ceased
and nothing else happened. As one uneventful minute
followed another, Pete gradually put the clamps on his
nerves.</p>

<p>"Ah dunno 'bout dat," he whispered. "Mebby dat floppin'
noise didun' mean nuffin', en den, ag'in, mebby it
<i>mout</i>. Hey, you, dar!" he added, lifting his voice.</p>

<p>The cry echoed across the creek, but the only answer
was the echo.</p>

<p>"If yo's one ob dem gliderin' spooks," called Pete, "den
you-all doan' want any truck wif <i>me</i>. Ah's on'y a po'
li'l moke, en Ah ain't nevah done no ha'm tuh nobody.
Ah's fibilus, occasion'ly, en now an' den Ah's tole a
whopper, but dem yarns doan' amount tuh nuffin'."</p>

<p>The silence continued, save for the soughing of the
wind and the "tu-whit, tu-whoo!" from the depths of the
woods.</p>

<p>"Ah done got tuh do somethin' tuh pass de time,"
thought Pete. "Ah'll frow de iv'ries, dat's whut Ah'll
do. Wonner where dar's a lantern?"</p>

<p>Pete remembered having seen a lantern in one of the
lockers while he was helping Matt with the engine. After
a little thought he located the lantern, and secured it.
Then he recalled having seen a box of matches in the
tool-chest, and he soon had the lantern going.</p>

<p>It's surprising what a soothing effect a light will have
on a superstitious mind that dreads the dark. With the
lantern on the stern thwart, Pete knelt in the boat's bottom
and cast his dice again and again, becoming so careless
of his "spookerous" surroundings that he almost forgot
his fears.</p>

<p>The little white cubes dropped and rattled on the
thwart, and Pete bent low to read the faces.</p>

<p>"Ah's got two dollahs," he muttered, surprised at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
lucky combinations turning up for him, "en Ah wisht dar
was some odder moke here tuh take er han' in dis game.
Ah's havin' mo' luck, here, all by mahse'f, dan I
evah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He straightened on his knees in sudden panic, then
dropped his head down on the thwart and covered his
face with his hands.</p>

<p>"Whut's dat?" he whimpered. "Whut's dat Ah hear?
Hit sounded monsus lak er chain rattlin'."</p>

<p>But it wasn't a chain; it was a good, well-developed
groan. It came from the darkness at the top of the bank
and echoed shiveringly across the creek.</p>

<p>"Dat wasn't no screech-owl," murmured Pete, in stifled
tones. "Golly! De ha'nts is comin' fo' me. Wisht Ah
was out ob here! Oh, I wisht Ah was some place else
where dar's folks, en buildin's, en 'lectric lights. Br-r-r!"</p>

<p>The groan was repeated. It was a hollow kind of
groan, long drawn out, and given in the most approved
ghostly style. Pete groaned on his own account, and
collapsed in the bottom of the boat, floundering forward
and trying to crawl into the motor and lose himself in
the machinery.</p>

<p>While the wretched little darky lay in a palpitating
heap under the steering wheel, a funereal voice was
wafted toward him&mdash;a voice that made him gasp, and
close his eyes, and shiver until he shook the boat.</p>

<p>"Who-o are you-u-u?" inquired the voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, lawsy! Oh, mah goodness!" fluttered Pete in
tremulous, incoherent tones. "Ah's as good as daid!
Ah's nevah gwine tuh git out ob dis alive! Der ha'nts
has cotched me! Oh, if I c'u'd only git away dis once,
Ah'll nevah brag no mo'! Ah'll nevah tell anodder whopper!"</p>

<p>"Who-o are you-u-u?" insisted the sepulchral voice
from the darkness at the top of the bank.</p>

<p>"Ah's er moke," whimpered Pete, "jes' a moke. You-all
go 'long an' nevah min' me. Ah ain't nevah done nuffin'&mdash;Pickerel
Pete's a good l'il coon. Please, Marse
Gose, go off some odder place en do yo' gliderin'. Oh,
gee! Oh, golly!"</p>

<p>"Go 'way, go 'way, go 'way!" ordered the "ghost."</p>

<p>"Ah'll go, yassuh," chattered Pete, "on'y doan' yo'
grab me as Ah run by. Dat's all. Yo' ain't layin' fo'
tuh grab me, is yuh?"</p>

<p>"Go 'way, go 'way, go 'way!" insisted the spook, with
hair-raising emphasis.</p>

<p>Pete got up slowly and cautiously in the boat. The
lantern threw a weird reflection over him, but the most
noticeable thing about the frightened little darky, just
then, was the white of his eyes. He shook like a person
with the ague, and nearly dropped into the water while
stepping from the gunwale of the boat.</p>

<p>Begging the spook not to grab him, he floundered up
the bank and darted into the timber as though the Old
Nick was after him. His piteous wail was lost in a
crashing of bushes, and finally even that sound died out.</p>

<p>A chuckling laugh echoed from the top of the bank,
and a form disentangled itself from the shadows.</p>

<p>"Come on, Kinky," called a voice. "That little nigger
was scared white. He'll not stop running until he gets
clear to Madison. What kind of a spook do I make, eh?"</p>

<p>"Pretty raw," answered another voice, as a second
form pushed out of the shadows and joined the first.
"You can fool a superstitious, half-grown darky, Ross,
but I wouldn't make a business of this ghost racket.
What was the good of it, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Well, that darky never came here alone in that boat."</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Some one must have come with him. Maybe the
boat's other passengers are the two kids we couldn't find
in the cabin."</p>

<p>"I don't know how it could be, Ross, but mebby you're
right. That's not a rowboat."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinkin', Kinky. Let's go down and
look her over. The darky was obliging enough to leave
a lighted lantern for us."</p>

<p>The two men descended to the boat, and Ross picked
up the lantern and swung it about him.</p>

<p>"It's a motor-boat, blamed if it ain't!" Kinky exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Right you are," chuckled Ross. "She must have come
up from the town. What's she doin' here at this time o'
night? Suspicious, that's what it is! I'll gamble heavy
the boat has somethin' to do with the young fellers in that
cabin."</p>

<p>"Well, like enough you're right," answered Kinky.
"But what's that to us? We came up the Catfish in a
boat, too, an' we'd better take to our oars an' go back
to town huntin' for Big John. If he overhauled Motor
Matt and got that money, we don't want to give him a
chance to get away from us."</p>

<p>"We'll see to <i>that</i>," grunted Ross decisively.</p>

<p>"It looked as though Big John was tryin' to sidetrack
us when he wanted us to keep watch of that cabin to-night.
What's the good of watchin' the cabin if he gets
the money? What's the use of keeping track of the other
two boys when King's the one we want?"</p>

<p>"Right again, Kinky. That brain of yours seems to
be doin' some brilliant work to-night. Here, take a hack
at this."</p>

<p>Ross turned and held out a bottle.</p>

<p>"If I take too many hacks at that, Ross," answered
Kinky, "the brilliant brain work is liable to stop."</p>

<p>Nevertheless he seized the bottle and a prolonged
gurgling followed. When he had finished, Ross took the
bottle back and gave some attention to it himself.</p>

<p>"All I want," growled Ross, as he screwed the top back
on the flask, "is to get a chance at this here Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Big John has already had a chance at him," suggested
Kinky.</p>

<p>"Will Big John do anythin' to even up with Motor
Matt for the way we was treated in 'Frisco Bay?" flung
back Ross. "Don't you never think it, Kinky. If Big
John gets the money, he'll turn the cub loose to make
some more trouble for us. I'm built along different lines,
myself. I want revenge, with a big R. That's me."</p>

<p>"Oh, slush!" grumbled Kinky. "You ought to have
left more of that stuff in the bottle. <i>Your</i> brain work's
anythin' but brilliant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean what I say, anyhow," rapped out Ross.</p>

<p>Picking up the lantern, he went forward, crawled over
the hood, and made a close examination of the forward
part of the boat.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What've you found?" demanded Kinky.</p>

<p>"What was the name of that chug-boat the Chink won
in 'Frisco, and that Motor Matt used in windin' us up?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sprite.</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't this knock you stiff? Say, Kinky, this
here's the <i>Sprite</i>."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"There's the name, plain enough."</p>

<p>"Then it's another <i>Sprite</i>. It's a common name, and
the 'Frisco <i>Sprite</i> couldn't be here."</p>

<p>"It's the same boat, you take it from me. It looks the
same, and by thunder it <i>is</i> the same."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it got here."</p>

<p>"Nor I&mdash;but here she is, for all that. Let's burn her!"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for this boat we'd have been on the
way to the Sandwich Islands by now. I'll feel a heap
better if we burn the blame thing."</p>

<p>"Aw, be sensible, can't you. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist!"</p>

<p>Ross interrupted Kinky with the warning syllable;
then, quickly, the lantern was extinguished, and Ross
crept back into the rear of the launch.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he whispered; "some one's coming."</p>

<p>"Then we'd better hike!"</p>

<p>"Not on your life! Crowd up forward, there. I
played the spook, a while ago, and now let's see how well
I can play the rle of the darky."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!"</p>

<p>Thus suddenly did Ross lay his snare. As Kinky crept
forward, Ross crouched in the stern; then followed the
brief colloquy between Matt and Ross, the latter imitating
the voice of the negro.</p>

<p>The instant Motor Matt dropped into the boat the
snare suddenly tightened.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ENEMIES TO BE FEARED.</p>


<p>As Matt fell his head struck against the gunwale of the
boat. His senses did not leave him entirely, but he was
stunned for a few moments and rendered incapable of
doing anything in his own defense. Before he recovered
sufficiently to struggle with his assailants the two men
had found a rope and had lashed his hands.</p>

<p>"Now for his feet, Kinky," said Ross. "This is a haul
I wasn't expectin', although we might have figured it
out, I guess, if we'd had time to think things over."</p>

<p>Matt kicked out with his feet in a desperate attempt to
overturn Kinky, and, perhaps, leap upright and jump
ashore.</p>

<p>"He's a fighter, all right," snarled Ross. "Here, I'll
hold him while you finish the job."</p>

<p>With hands bound and two men to secure his ankles,
resistance was worse than useless. When the binding
was done, and Matt was lying helpless, he had a chance
to study the faces of his captors while Kinky was relighting
the lantern.</p>

<p>Ross' talk had already given Matt an inkling of the
two men's identity. The gleam from the lantern left no
doubt about their being Big John's pals.</p>

<p>Matt was not surprised that the two rascals should be
in that part of the country. They and Big John were
birds of a feather, and it was quite natural that all three
should flock together. What did surprise Matt, however,
was the fact that Kinky and Ross should be in that
particular place, and have laid their plans to capture him.</p>

<p>"Surprise party, eh?" queried Ross. "You weren't
expectin' to meet a couple of old friends, eh, Motor Matt?
Oh, you're not so much. You're cracked up pretty high,
but I reckon you're not any brighter than the rest of us.
Wonder if you've got ten thousand about you that we
could borrow for a while?"</p>

<p>"You're after that money," said Matt, "and you're
fooled. You won't get it, and neither will Big John. It
has been in Mr. Lorry's hands ever since noon. You
didn't think I'd bring ten thousand dollars back with me
in cash, did you? The money was in the form of a draft,
payable to Mr. Lorry, and it wouldn't have benefited you
or Big John any if you had stolen it."</p>

<p>"That's luck for old Lorry, then," answered Ross,
pushing his hand into Matt's pockets. "Here's a roll," he
added, drawing some bills out of Matt's vest. "It's
hardly big enough for the ten thousand, but I reckon
we'll have to be satisfied with what we can get."</p>

<p>"If you take that," said Matt, "you'll be in trouble
with the law before you're many hours older. So far as
San Francisco is concerned, I'm willing to let bygones
be bygones; but if you take my money I'll do everything
I can to have you caught."</p>

<p>Kinky seemed nervous. Ross, however, was reckless
and in an evil temper.</p>

<p>"We'll <i>not</i> get ourselves into trouble," he flared. "By
the time we're through with you, my hearty, there won't
be anybody to make us trouble."</p>

<p>Ross brought out his flask again and helped himself
liberally to its contents.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, extending the flask toward Kinky.</p>

<p>"I guess I've had enough," demurred Kinky.</p>

<p>"Take it, you fool!" cried Ross; "you'll need it before
we're done with this night's work."</p>

<p>Not until that moment did Motor Matt realize that here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
were two enemies who were seriously to be feared. He
had thought, when he recognized his captors, that they
had merely made a prisoner of him in the hope of securing
the ten thousand dollars, but now he realized that
there was something more villainous, perhaps more murderous,
back of their scheming.</p>

<p>Liquor arouses the evil passions of men and makes
them ripe for deeds they would not think of committing
when in their sober senses. Kinky and Ross were partly
intoxicated. Kinky was the less desperate of the two villains,
mainly because he was the more cowardly.</p>

<p>Matt hardened himself to face whatever might be coming.</p>

<p>"You'd better think well about this, Ross," said he.
"All you've got to do to keep clear of the law is to return
my money, set me at liberty, and take yourselves off.
I'll forget what you've done, and what happened in San
Francisco Bay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's more than we'll do, you young cub," scowled
Ross. "You hadn't any notion I followed you all the way
from 'Frisco, on the same train, had you? You didn't
know I got off the train at Waunakee, when you got off,
and that I trailed you and your two friends to that cabin
in the woods, eh? And I don't believe, when you and
your pards were talking in that cabin, that you had any
notion I was hanging around and listening. But I was.
I knew one of you was to go into town this morning with
the money for old Lorry, so it was me that put Big John
wise and had him waiting for you on the road. But do
you think I rigged myself out in different clothes and
followed you clear from 'Frisco just in the hope of getting
that money? You're wrong if you do think that. I
was after something else&mdash;and that was to <i>play even</i>.
It's a habit of mine always to settle my accounts. Big
John works differently&mdash;but I'm not responsible for what
he does, or doesn't do. When I lay out a course and take
the bit in my teeth, nothing can stop me."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"But, I say, Ross," began Kinky in faint protest, "you
don't intend to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait till I ask you to talk," cut in Ross. "You can
bobble more in your conversation than any man I ever
knew."</p>

<p>"Do you know where my two friends are?" queried
Matt. "You know who I mean&mdash;young Lorry and McGlory."</p>

<p>"We don't know where they are. I don't object to telling
you if that will make you any easier in your mind."</p>

<p>"Where's the colored boy that was here with the boat?"</p>

<p>"I played spook and scared him out. He's on the way
to Madison, and is hitting only the high places. Is this
the old <i>Sprite</i> you used in 'Frisco Bay?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Glad to know it. She'll go up in smoke before we're
done with her."</p>

<p>Ross' veiled hints of what he was going to do did not
bother Matt very much. He had a hearty contempt for a
boaster&mdash;even a desperate boaster of Ross' stamp.</p>

<p>The scoundrel was in a communicative mood, and
many points which had been dark to Matt were being
cleared away.</p>

<p>"What has Big John done," Matt asked, "to get Mr.
Lorry down on me?"</p>

<p>Ross laughed huskily.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" he answered. "Big John is about
as sly as they make 'em. I didn't know he'd done anything
to get Lorry down on you&mdash;didn't think he'd have
the nerve to go near Lorry. You got away from that pal
of ours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I wish John was here with us. He's probably
as mad as a hornet over losing that money, and would
make a better stand-by than Kinky."</p>

<p>"I never go back on a pal," expanded Kinky, "but I
think a pal ought to be sensible and not kick up too big
a row for his own good."</p>

<p>"You'll find the row plenty big enough if you go too
far," warned Matt, speaking for Kinky's especial benefit.</p>

<p>Kinky stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>"It's a case," declared Ross, "where we've got to go as
far as we can. That's what'll make it safe for us. Kinky
and me have been loafing in the woods all day. We were
not to report to Big John until to-night. It's safer for
us, you understand, to get together at night than at any
other time."</p>

<p>Matt had been working desperately at the cord that
bound his hands. The cord was drawn tight and firmly
knotted, and his efforts had not met with much success.</p>

<p>Ross suddenly detected him in his work, and, with an
oath, jerked him over and looked at the rope.</p>

<p>"That's enough of that," he said sternly. "Suppose
you do get rid of the rope, how'll it help you? You lay
still and be quiet, that's your cue."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do, Ross?" inquired Kinky
nervously.</p>

<p>"You're going up on the bank and cast off the painter,"
returned Ross. "I don't think you're any too steady on
your feet, so be careful."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to cast off the painter for?
We've got a boat of our own, and we don't need this."</p>

<p>"I'm engineerin' this deal, Kinky," said Ross sharply.
"Do as I say, or else take to the woods and let me do it
alone."</p>

<p>Kinky got up and staggered ashore. Although he
worked awkwardly, yet he finally succeeded in releasing
the painter and throwing the rope aboard. Then he
scrambled back into the boat himself.</p>

<p>Ross, meanwhile, had been starting the engine. He
proceeded in a way that proved he had some knowledge
of motors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning the <i>Sprite</i>, Ross sent her slowly toward the
mouth of the creek, peering sharply ahead as they moved
through the water.</p>

<p>"There she is," muttered Ross, shutting off the power.</p>

<p>As the <i>Sprite</i> came to a halt, Ross reached over the
side and caught the gunwale of another boat.</p>

<p>"We'll tow our boat behind, Kinky," announced Ross.
"Climb into her and make sure the oars are safe inboard,
then fasten her painter to the stern of the <i>Sprite</i>."</p>

<p>This rather difficult operation was safely accomplished,
and then, with the rowboat in tow, the launch glided out
of the creek into the Catfish, and down the Catfish
toward Fourth Lake.</p>

<p>How was that voyage to end for Motor Matt?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER.</p>


<p>Matt's position in the boat enabled him to watch one
dark bank of the river as they glided down toward the
lake. He was listening and looking for some sign of
life on the bank. Had he seen any one, a shout would
quickly have apprised the person of the prisoner's predicament.</p>

<p>But Matt saw no one. Steadily the <i>Sprite</i> glided onward&mdash;steadily,
but covering so crooked a course that
Matt wondered they did not drive into the bank on one
side or the other.</p>

<p>The lake was reached. The storm promised by the late
afternoon was slow in coming. The wind was no higher
than it had been, two or three hours before, but the waves
were beating sullenly on the rocks as if in warning of
what was to come.</p>

<p>Far across the lake Matt could see the glare of city
lights. Because of his position in the boat, the other
shore of the lake was not visible to him.</p>

<p>He was looking for other boats, but there were very
few boats on the lake at the time. He saw one moving
light, however, and essayed a lusty call for help.</p>

<p>Ross swore savagely.</p>

<p>"Clap a hand over that cub's mouth!" he snapped.</p>

<p>At the same instant he jerked one hand from the
wheel, caught up the lantern, and dropped it overboard.</p>

<p>Kinky, meanwhile, had forced his hands over Matt's
lips.</p>

<p>The light Matt had seen had shifted its position, and
was gliding toward the <i>Sprite</i>.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" called a voice from the dark.</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself," flung back Ross.</p>

<p>"Did you hail us?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I thought some one yelled. What became of your
light?"</p>

<p>"A lubber here with me knocked it overboard."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better get out another. If you take my
advice, you won't stay out long, either. There's nasty
weather coming, and we're making for our berth over at
the asylum."</p>

<p>Ross allowed this warning to go unanswered. The
light of the other boat dwindled away and vanished in the
gloom.</p>

<p>"This is far enough, I reckon," Ross remarked, halting
the <i>Sprite</i>. "You can leave him alone now, Kinky," he
added. "He could yell till he's black in the face and no
one would hear him; but, if he knows what's good for
him, he won't whoop it up while we're close to him. Pull
the rowboat up alongside, Kinky."</p>

<p>Ross lifted the hood and leaned down into the space
reserved for the motor and the gasoline tanks.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" he exclaimed, lifting himself erect, "I
wish I had that lantern now."</p>

<p>He continued to grumble and work around in the bow
of the boat. At last he finished his labor, whatever it
was, and turned to Kinky.</p>

<p>The latter was holding the rowboat alongside the
launch. The task was none too easy, as the swell was
bumping the boats together and then forcing them apart.</p>

<p>"What am I to do, Ross?" asked Kinky. "I can't hang
on here much longer."</p>

<p>"Get into the rowboat and take the oars," ordered Ross.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going along with me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, when I get through."</p>

<p>"What's your game?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," was the angry retort. "It's my
game, from now on, and you'll watch and do as you're
told. Get into the boat and hold her close to the <i>Sprite</i>
with the oars. When I want you I'll let you know. Mind
your eye when you change or you'll find yourself at the
bottom of the lake."</p>

<p>Kinky made three attempts to get from one boat into
the other. At the last attempt he came near swamping
the rowboat, and when he drew back and clung panting
to the side of the <i>Sprite</i> the rowboat had got away from
him.</p>

<p>Ross shouted his maledictions.</p>

<p>"What can you expect of a fellow workin' like this
in the dark?" grunted Kinky. "I ain't no sailor, anyway."</p>

<p>"You got feet and hands, haven't you? Then why
don't you use 'em?"</p>

<p>With this retort, Ross started the motor and laid the
<i>Sprite</i> alongside the rowboat once more.</p>

<p>"Now," he ordered, "try it again, Kinky. If you get a
spill you'll stay in the lake for all of me."</p>

<p>Kinky's next effort was more successful. He had a
narrow escape, but he finally plumped down into the bottom
of the rowboat, righted himself unsteadily, and got
on the 'midships thwart. A moment more and he had
shipped the oars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now what?" he demanded.</p>

<p>His own temper was beginning to rise at the rough,
and perhaps unnecessary, work he had been made to do.</p>

<p>Ross had again switched off the power of the motor
and the launch was rolling in the waves.</p>

<p>"Wait, and I'll tell you," answered Ross.</p>

<p>He was lashing the steering wheel with a piece of rope.
Kinky could not see what he was doing, or he would
probably have ventured some remarks. Matt, however,
was able to follow the scoundrel's movements, and a
vague alarm ran through him.</p>

<p>"What are you up to, Ross?" asked Matt sternly.</p>

<p>Ross snarled at him, but did not make any response
that could be understood.</p>

<p>"I suppose you could get at this wheel, bound as you
are," muttered Ross, turning around, at last, and facing
Matt. "But I'll fix that," he added with a brutal laugh.</p>

<p>Making his way to where Matt was lying, he caught
him by the shoulders and dragged him roughly forward.</p>

<p>"What are you doing this for?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>Ross was strong, and, without deigning a reply, he
heaved the helpless youth up onto the hood. Bound as
he was, Matt's position was precarious in the extreme.</p>

<p>"I never thought you were such a scoundrel, Ross,"
Matt said quietly. "It can't be you're going to leave me
like this."</p>

<p>"You wait till I get through," was the fierce answer.</p>

<p>By craning his head around, Matt could see Ross pick
up a pile of waste. From the pungent odor of gasoline
which assailed Matt's nostrils he knew that the waste had
been soaked in the inflammable stuff.</p>

<p>Ross carried the waste back into the stern of the boat.</p>

<p>"You like motors, King," called Ross, "and I'm going
to give you such a ride on a motor-boat as you never had
before. I hope you'll enjoy it."</p>

<p>"For the last time, Ross," called Matt, horribly conscious
of the trend the scoundrel's work was taking, "I
ask you to think of what you are doing."</p>

<p>"I've thought of it all I'm going to. It's a fine plan,
and I'm going to carry it right through to a finish."</p>

<p>Ross turned to the rowboat, which Kinky was keeping
close to the <i>Sprite</i>.</p>

<p>"Come alongside, Kinky," Ross called. "I'm about
ready to be taken off."</p>

<p>"What have you been doin', Ross?" demanded Kinky,
pulling the other boat closer.</p>

<p>Matt felt, at that moment, as though Kinky was his
only hope.</p>

<p>"He's got me tied here on the hood, Kinky," Matt
called, "and he's going to fire the boat! If you let him
keep on, you'll be equally guilty with him, and the law
will sooner or later take care of you both."</p>

<p>"Let him talk!" exclaimed Ross. "Much good it'll do
him. A little more to the left, Kinky."</p>

<p>The man in the rowboat had turned to look.</p>

<p>"Is that him on that forward deck, Ross?" asked
Kinky.</p>

<p>"That's where I put him."</p>

<p>"Blazes! Why, he's liable to roll off into the water and
be drowned. What did you put him there for?"</p>

<p>"I told you I was attendin' to this," retorted Ross.
"Get that boat alongside here, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>"But I'm not goin' to stand for any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're going to do as I tell you. Get alongside."</p>

<p>Kinky, unfortunately for Matt, had the weaker will of
the two. He was plainly afraid of Ross, and the latter
could bullyrag him into doing anything.</p>

<p>As the rowboat came up, Ross leaned over and grabbed
the painter. Securing the end of it to the driver's seat of
the launch, he stepped back into the stern, struck a match,
and dropped it into the heap of waste.</p>

<p>A fire leaped upward instantly, and a yell of consternation
broke from Kinky.</p>

<p>"Ross, you're mad! You want to make a swinging job
of this for both of us, I guess. Put out that blaze or I'll
put it out myself."</p>

<p>Ross did not reply. Hastening forward again, he
started the motor, and the <i>Sprite</i> began driving ahead,
hauling the rowboat with it.</p>

<p>"This course, Motor Matt," said Ross, "will carry you
direct to Maple Bluff. I hope you'll have a comfortable
landing. Good-by, and good luck to you! Have I paid
my debts? Think it over."</p>

<p>Whirling swiftly, Ross clambered into the rowboat.</p>

<p>"I'll not stand for this!" yelled Kinky. "This may be
your idea of paying your debts, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ross pushed Kinky backward, sending him sprawling
across the 'midships thwart.</p>

<p>"Get up and take the oars," he cried. "Pal of mine
though you are, if you try to make me any more trouble
something will happen to you. I've got the bit in my
teeth, I tell you, and I'll settle for Motor Matt as I think
best."</p>

<p>Ross leaned forward and slashed the blade of his
pocketknife through the painter, and a hoarse laugh
echoed in Motor Matt's ears as the burning launch leaped
away through the thick shadows.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CHUMS TO THE RESCUE.</p>


<p>Matt was several moments realizing the terrible predicament
in which Ross had placed him. The glowing
fire in the stern of the <i>Sprite</i> lighted the darkness with a
ghastly glare.</p>

<p>The boat was on fire and speeding, with a lashed wheel,
across the troubled waters of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>What could Matt do to save himself? It was a time
when he must think quickly. He would also have to act
with promptness and decision&mdash;an impossibility in his
helpless state.</p>

<p>If he could roll back over the hood, he might contrive
to get aft and, in some manner, smother the fire.</p>

<p>He made the attempt&mdash;and succeeded, although not
until he had come within an inch of sliding off the
rounded hood and into the lake.</p>

<p>As he fell into the bottom of the boat, he struck the
lever that controlled the sparking apparatus, throwing
off the switch and causing the <i>Sprite</i> to slow to a halt.</p>

<p>This was a little gained, for the speed of the boat
would not now fan the flames; but Matt was wedged
in between the driver's seat and the motor, and found it
impossible to extricate himself.</p>

<p>His heart sank.</p>

<p>Was this to be the end? Was the <i>Sprite</i> to burn and
sink, there in the open lake, and carry him to the bottom?</p>

<p>At this moment, just as his hopes were at the lowest
ebb, he heard a shout from near at hand.</p>

<p>"Matt! Where are you, pard?"</p>

<p>McGlory! That was McGlory's voice!</p>

<p>The wonder of McGlory's being there to help him was
lost, for the moment, in the wild joy that swelled in
Matt's breast.</p>

<p>"Here!" he shouted.</p>

<p>A whoop of delight came from McGlory.</p>

<p>"We've found him, George!" Matt heard him exclaim.</p>

<p>Then there came a splash of oars and a jolt as another
boat bumped against the <i>Sprite</i>.</p>

<p>"Hold her steady, pard," McGlory went on, "and I'll
get Matt out of this in a brace of shakes."</p>

<p>The next moment the cowboy scrambled into the
launch.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Matt?" called McGlory.</p>

<p>"Never mind me," Matt answered; "put out the fire.
Beat it out&mdash;use your coat."</p>

<p>The fire looked worse than it was in reality. Not
much of the woodwork was afire, but the blazing waste
had been scattered by the wind and was sending up
smoke and flame from the stern almost to the driver's
seat.</p>

<p>McGlory was thinking more about Matt than he was
about the boat. However, he had his orders and did not
stop to do any arguing. Jerking off his coat, he got to
work at once.</p>

<p>Lorry helped. Fastening the skiff which had brought
him and McGlory off from the shore, he likewise removed
his coat, and the little <i>Sprite</i> rocked and pitched
with the mad efforts of the two boys to get the best of
the blaze.</p>

<p>Inside of five minutes they had the last flame smothered.
While George dipped up water with his cap and
deluged the smoking woodwork, McGlory pulled Matt
out of his cramped quarters.</p>

<p>"Well, speak to me about this!" gasped McGlory.
"He's tied! Say, this would make the hair stand on a
buffalo robe. Lashed hand and foot and turned adrift
out in the middle of the lake! Sufferin' volcanoes! Who
did it, pard?"</p>

<p>"Get the ropes off me," said Matt, "and then I can
talk to better advantage. My arms are numb clear to the
shoulder."</p>

<p>McGlory pulled a knife from his pocket and groped
carefully while he cut the cords.</p>

<p>"It seems like a dream," muttered Matt.</p>

<p>"Nightmare, you mean," returned McGlory. "If I'd
been in such a fix I'd 'a' thrown a fit."</p>

<p>"And then to have you fellows come!" went on Matt.
"I don't know how you managed it, but here you are,
and here I am, and I guess the old <i>Sprite</i> is good for several
trips yet. Shake!"</p>

<p>McGlory caught Matt's outstretched hand and gave it
a hearty pressure. As soon as the cowboy was through,
Matt leaned over and gave Lorry's hand a cordial grip.</p>

<p>"I'll never forget what you have done for me," declared
Matt.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" muttered McGlory. "That's what pards are
for&mdash;to help one another when they're in a tight pinch.
And I'm an Injun if this <i>wasn't</i> a tight one. But see
here, once, Matt. You called this boat the <i>Sprite</i>."</p>

<p>"That's her name, Joe."</p>

<p>"Queer they'd have another motor boat, same size and
rig of that 'Frisco launch and with the same name, here
at Madison."</p>

<p>"It's the same <i>Sprite</i>."</p>

<p>"Not the same boat you fellows used in Frisco Bay!"
exclaimed Lorry.</p>

<p>"The same identical boat," returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that rattle your spurs?" breathed McGlory.
"But how did she get here?"</p>

<p>"By express."</p>

<p>"Who sent her?"</p>

<p>"Ping."</p>

<p>"Ping! And did the yaller mug come with her?"</p>

<p>"If he did I haven't seen him."</p>

<p>"Why," went on Lorry, "the boat came through nearly
as quick as we did!"</p>

<p>"How did Ping know where to send her?" asked McGlory.</p>

<p>"He could have found that out easy enough. They
knew at police headquarters that we were coming to
Madison."</p>

<p>"And she came by express!"</p>

<p>"Yes, with charges of over two hundred and fifty dollars
for transportation."</p>

<p>"Tell me about that!" McGlory nearly fell off his
seat. "But that's just like a heathen Chinee. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
he thought the charges wouldn't be more'n a dollar and
a half. And they were over two-fifty! Sufferin' millionaires!"</p>

<p>"It's all well enough to talk," put in Lorry, "but there
are lots more comfortable places than a motor boat,
with a dead engine, in the middle of the lake."</p>

<p>"That's right, too," agreed McGlory. "Every once
in a while little George, the child wonder, gets a bean
on the right number. It will be blowing great guns on
this stretch of water before morning. I move we hike."</p>

<p>"Where'll we hike?"</p>

<p>"Did you fix things up in Madison?" George inquired.</p>

<p>"Not the way I wanted to, George," said Matt. "We'll
have to talk about that."</p>

<p>"Then we won't go to Madison," declared George,
"and that's settled. We might as well haul off into the
Catfish and spend the night in the boat."</p>

<p>"There used to be a 'tarp' for coverin' her in rough
weather," put in McGlory. "Was Ping thoughtful
enough to send all the stuff that belonged to her?"</p>

<p>"He was," said Matt, "at thirty-seven dollars and fifty
cents a hundred pounds&mdash;three times the merchandise
rate."</p>

<p>"Oh, glory! What did you take the boat off the express
company's hands for, pard?"</p>

<p>"For the reason, Joe, that I had use for her."</p>

<p>"And this is the kind of use you've been putting her
to!" muttered the cowboy. "It wasn't worth the price,
not by a whole row of 'dobies."</p>

<p>The waves were rolling higher and higher, and the
<i>Sprite</i> was pitching like an unruly broncho.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get out of this," said Lorry, as the
skiff alongside smashed against the <i>Sprite's</i> bulwarks
and gave them all a rough shaking. "The wind's carrying
us toward Maple Bluff, and I don't want any experience
with the bluff on a night like this. Where's a
lantern? Is there one aboard?"</p>

<p>"There was," answered Matt, "but Ross threw it into
the lake."</p>

<p>"Ross!" gulped McGlory. "You don't mean to say
you've seen him?"</p>

<p>"We'll go over all that later," said Matt. "We'll
make for the Catfish as fast as we can."</p>

<p>"That's as good a place as any, I reckon, seeing as
how George isn't ready to go to Madison."</p>

<p>Matt opened the hood and sniffed at the engine to
ascertain if there was any waste gasoline dripping from
the tanks. He decided that the tanks were all closed.</p>

<p>The engine was started and Matt brought the boat's
nose around into the wind. The trailing skiff was allowed
to fall behind to the end of its mooring chain.</p>

<p>There was thunder, off in the west, and an occasional
sharp flash of lightning. The flashes served to guide
Matt over the course he had recently covered, while a
prisoner in the hands of Ross and Kinky.</p>

<p>As he held the <i>Sprite</i> steadily to her course, more and
more the wonder grew upon him as to the timely arrival
of McGlory and George. Although Matt, when bound
and cast adrift, had left a fiery trail over the lake, yet
he was positive that the grewsome beacon alone had
not been responsible for the providential appearance of
his two friends.</p>

<p>But everything would soon be made clear, and Matt
hurried the moment of explanation by driving the launch
at her best speed.</p>

<p>The wind, of course, delayed the boat appreciably,
but her sharp bows cut the water like a knife, and the
white spray went swirling upward on both sides of the
craft, high into the night.</p>

<p>It was an exhilarating ride, and thoroughly enjoyed
by Matt and George. McGlory loved boats, but he had
been built for a landsman, and the roll and tumble of
rough water gave him unpleasant feelings in the region
of the stomach.</p>

<p>The cowboy drew a long breath of relief when the
launch battled her way into the quieter waters of the
Catfish, and he sprang eagerly ashore to make the boat
fast to a tree, under the lee of a steep bank.</p>

<p>"There's a boathouse near here," said George, when
the skiff had also been secured, "and the proper move for
us is to make for it and break in. The rain will be
coming down in sheets before long. The boathouse belongs
to a friend of mine, and he won't make much of
a fuss when he knows who it was broke into the place."</p>

<p>Before Matt left the launch he spread the tarpaulin
over it carefully and made the edges secure to the metal
pins along the gunwale; then, led by Lorry, the boys
made their way to the boathouse.</p>

<p>Forcing an entrance was not difficult, and just as the
lads got inside the rain began.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HOW FATE THREW THE DICE.</p>


<p>There was a rough but comfortable sitting room in
one end of the boathouse. Lorry, who was familiar with
the place, left Matt and McGlory near the door which
they had forced open, and groped his way to the sitting
room, where he lighted a tin lamp.</p>

<p>There was a smell of stale cigarette smoke in the
room, and the walls were papered with pictures of prize
fighters, sailboats, race horses, and "footlight favorites,"
all cut from newspapers and magazines. This, and the
acrid odor of cigarettes, attested sufficiently the taste of
the owner of the boathouse.</p>

<p>There were chairs enough to seat the three boys comfortably.</p>

<p>"Somebody has been here, pards," declared McGlory,
"and not so very long ago, either."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a Sherlock Holmes, all right," grinned Lorry.
"How do you suppose he knew that, Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"Oh, go on!" growled the cowboy. "Your friend
George is a cigarette fiend. Why do you reckon the windows
were draped like that?"</p>

<p>There were two small windows in the sitting room,
and each was covered with a double thickness of canvas,
battened down on all sides.</p>

<p>"Give it up," said Lorry. "Ollie must have been having
a game of cards here with some of the boys, and
probably he didn't want anybody looking in."</p>

<p>"Ollie?" murmured Matt, startled, suddenly remembering
that, at the time of the attempted robbery on the
Waunakee road, Big John had addressed his youthful
companion as "Ollie."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ollie Merton," answered Lorry; "he's the fellow
who owns this place."</p>

<p>"What sort of looking fellow is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's about my build, rather dark, and with a
face that's not much of a recommendation; but Ollie's
been a good friend of mine, just the same."</p>

<p>Matt was convinced that the Ollie he had met on the
Waunakee road, under such evil conditions, was the
same Ollie who had papered that rude little sitting room&mdash;and
had left behind him the reek of his cigarettes.</p>

<p>"What are you asking about Ollie for?" inquired
Lorry curiously.</p>

<p>"We'll get to that in a few minutes," said Matt. "Just
now I want to hear how you fellows came to leave the
cabin on the creek, and what sort of a coincidence it was
that enabled you to come to my rescue, out there on the
lake."</p>

<p>"I reckon we can explain that a heap easier than you
can explain how you came to be lashed hand and foot
and jammed between the thwart and the engine of a
burning boat," returned McGlory. "You didn't get
back to the cabin, that was one of the things that bothered
George and me, and we couldn't savvy the why of
it; then, all at once, we spotted our old friends, Ross
and Kinky, standing among the oaks and piping off the
cabin. <i>Was</i> it a jolt? Say, speak to me about that.
'That means trouble,' said George, and I allowed that he
had rung the bell.</p>

<p>"There we'd been congratulatin' ourselves that no one
knew of the hang-out, when along comes those 'Frisco
gents, loafing in the scrub and taking the sizing of our
wickiup. Having made up our minds that the appearance
of Ross and Kinky spelled trouble with a big T,
George and me got to guessing that those two lads had
somehow interfered with your getting back to the cabin,
Matt.</p>

<p>"'We'll duck out of this, George,' says I, 'and you
can bet your moccasins on <i>that</i>. And when we duck,'
I says further, 'we'll take the luggage and the grub along
with us.'</p>

<p>"'But what about Matt?' says George. 'He's trying
to do something for me, in Madison, and it looks kind
of rough to scatter when maybe he'll whistle for this
siding even if he is somewhat behind his running time.
Didn't you tell me that Motor Matt usually does what
he says he'll do?'</p>

<p>"You must admit, Matt, that this cousin of mine is
improving a whole lot or he'd never have thought of
that. Up to now, he's been so busy taking care of
Number One that he hasn't had any consideration for
the rest of the human race. But I explains to him like
this:</p>

<p>"'Georgie, we're makin' a change of base. That's all.
When we dodge those tinhorns, and pile our traps in
another part of the woods, we'll sneak back here on the
q. t. and watch for Matt. Like as not we can head him
off on the Waunakee road before he reaches the bridge
over the creek.'</p>

<p>"George thought that would be all right, so we get our
plunder together, sneak out of the cabin, drop over the
edge of the creek bank, crawl a mile downstream, and
sashay right into the woods. I don't know whether you'll
believe it or not&mdash;things like that happen mostly in story
books&mdash;but we find the neatest cave you ever crawled
into right on the banks of the Catfish. George says it's
a second edition of Black Hawk's cave. Well, say, after
we get the bats out of that hole in the rock, we are
almost as snug as we are here, this minute. Sufferin'
Niagara, hear it pour!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the rain, Joe," said Matt. "Your talk
is mighty exciting. Go on with it."</p>

<p>"Of course," proceeded McGlory, "we couldn't enjoy
our cave while you were due to arrive at the cabin any
minute and drop into the hands of Ross and Kinky. I
reckon it was about eight o'clock into dewfall when
George and me crawled out of that hole and started to
make a short cut for the Waunakee road. Then, right
in the middle of the dark, we heard somethin' coming
our way just a-tearin'. George guessed bears and I
guessed Injuns; but, no, we were both fooled. It was a
little negro&mdash;George struck a match and got his color
a minute after him and me had collided and I had
flopped him on his back and was holding him down.
Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pickerel Pete!" exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>"That's a guess for your life. Sure, pard, it was
Pickerel Pete, and a scared Pickerel he was, at that. He
thought George and me was a pair of 'ha'nts,' whatever
they are; but George knew him, and he braced up some
when he made sure that we were perfectly human.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;speak to me about what that little ebony chap
told us! Motor Matt had hired him for two plunks a
day&mdash;you're getting reckless with your money, pard&mdash;and
he had piloted Motor Matt from Third Lake to
Fourth, and from Fourth up the Catfish to Whisky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Creek. Motor Matt had left the boat tied up there, with
Blackberry on guard, and gone on afoot up the creek.
Then spooks arrived, ordered Pete to duck, and he had
started for home like a singed cat. He was on his way
when he ran into us.</p>

<p>"Well, George and me was all crinkled up with a
scare. Matt's gone on to the cabin, we figure it out,
and he's dropped into the hands of Ross and Kinky. We
make a run for the cabin. No one there, not even Ross
and Kinky. But there's a candle still burnin' on the
corner shelf.</p>

<p>"Was it Motor Matt who lit that candle, we asked
ourselves, or Big John's pals? Of course we couldn't
tell that, but we allowed it was probably Matt who had
struck a light. Then it was us for the mouth of the
creek to see what was going on at the launch.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you, pard, that George and I had
found a skiff, while we were fooling around the creek
bank, waiting for you to get back. The skiff pleased me&mdash;I
never saw a boat yet that didn't&mdash;and I suggested to
George that we paddle down the creek in the skiff. That
would save climbing fences and blundering around in
the dark. Well, we took the skiff. It didn't draw much
more'n a drink of water, and, although the creek is lower
than usual at this time of year, according to George,
we got down it all right. Just as we got within hailing
distance of the launch, we heard the chug of an engine,
and some one calling from the boat to some one else on
the bank. We'd found Ross and Kinky&mdash;their voices
give 'em away; and from what they said later we also
knew that we'd found <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>"George and I were up a tree for fair, then. Ross
and Kinky were 'heeled'&mdash;we didn't have to guess any
about that&mdash;while all I had was a pocketknife, and all
George had was a scarfpin.</p>

<p>"'Well,' says George, 'I'm not going to leave those
tinhorns to do what they please with Matt.' Surprisin',
eh, the way this cousin of mine is beginnin' to act? He
was as nervy as a Ute buck with an overload of tizwin.
I asks George what he thinks we can do against two
men with a pair of hardware hornets that sting six
times apiece. George didn't know, but allowed we'd
better drop down the creek and get a closer view.</p>

<p>"By the time we got down to where the launch was
she had moved on and stopped again. When she moved
on once more, something was trailing behind her. It was
so dark we couldn't see what the thing was very plain,
but after some sort of a while we made out that it was
a boat. Well, how we ever did it I don't know, but
George&mdash;it was George, mind you&mdash;made our chain
painter fast to the stern of the trailing rowboat&mdash;and
that's the sort of procession we made down the Catfish."
McGlory threw back his head and laughed till
he shook. "First, the launch," he went on; "then the
rowboat, then George, and me, and the skiff. Sufferin'
side-wheelers! Why, I nearly gave the snap away enjoying
it."</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" muttered Matt. "When we went
down the Catfish, I was watching the bank, hoping to
see some one I could call to. And there were you and
George behind us all the time! I wish Ross and Kinky
knew about that."</p>

<p>"It was too much fun to last, pard," continued McGlory,
sobering a little. "When we got out into the
lake the heavier swell made the chain break loose from
the rowboat, and we had to follow with the oars, which
was slow work. We were a long ways off when you
spoke that other launch; and when you started like a
streak of fire for the northwest end of the lake, we were
still so far off that we didn't think we could reach you
in time to do you any good. But we broke our backs
at the oars, and managed to make it. You know the
rest."</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed Matt admiringly. "Say, you fellows
are pards worth having. What became of Pickerel
Pete?"</p>

<p>"Bother him!" put in George. "We didn't have any
time to fool with the little moke after we heard what
he had to tell us about you."</p>

<p>"He kept on toward town, burnin' the air," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"I think," said Matt reflectively, "that this cave of
yours would be a safer place for us than this boathouse."</p>

<p>"Safer," returned the cowboy, "but it hasn't got any
chairs and nothing to make a light with. Hear the rain,
once! Gee, <i>compadres</i>, I wouldn't move from here to
the cave, through all that water, for a bushel of double
eagles."</p>

<p>"Why is the cave safer?" asked Lorry.</p>

<p>"Because this Ollie Merton isn't such a friend of yours
as you think," said Matt.</p>

<p>George Lorry stiffened in the old, arrogant way.</p>

<p>"I guess I know my friends," he answered frigidly.</p>

<p>"Listen," went on Matt. "When I left the cabin and
started along the Waunakee road, some one in the bushes
threw a riata at me. It was Big John threw the rope,
and along with Big John was this Ollie Merton. They
were after that ten thousand dollars, but I played a trick
on them and got away with the draft. It was your sister,
George, that helped me get away."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed George; "not Ethel?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She was on the Waunakee road with her motor
car&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>George scowled.</p>

<p>"The governor would put twenty-five hundred in a
runabout for sis," he growled, "and wouldn't scrip up
when I wanted a motor boat. Is that right? Is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Voices were heard outside, accompanying a slushy
crunch of wet gravel. Matt leaped for the light and
blew it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a word!" he whispered. "That must be Ollie
Merton, and we don't want him to see us. There's an
overturned catboat&mdash;get under it."</p>

<p>Lorry tried to protest, but Matt caught him by the
arm and hustled him toward the overturned boat. The
boat had been lying under the boys' eyes during their
talk. Barely had they secreted themselves when the
door opened and two persons walked in, followed by a
whirling gust of rain.</p>

<p>"Whoosh!" called a familiar voice, "I'm glad to get
out of that, Ollie."</p>

<p>"Big John!" whispered Matt in Lorry's ear. "He's
come here with Merton. Keep quiet, now, and listen."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">UNDER THE OVERTURNED BOAT.</p>


<p>When Matt, Lorry, and McGlory had made forcible
entrance into the boathouse, it had been through the door
that fronted the river. Merton and Big John had entered
through a door at the other end of the house.
Thus, for a time, at least, the broken lock on the other
door was not discovered.</p>

<p>"Light up," went on the voice of Big John. "And if
you've got anything in a bottle, Ollie, trot it out and
mebby it'll drive the chill from our bones. I'm not pinin'
for an attack of rheumatism."</p>

<p>"I've got that, too," answered Ollie, with a fatuous
snicker. "Always keep something for snake bites."</p>

<p>"And it's a bad thing for a lad of your years. Hurry
up with the light."</p>

<p>"Give me time to get out of this mackintosh and then
I'll hunt for matches."</p>

<p>There followed the slap of a wet garment on the floor.
The next moment a match was struck, and young Merton
could be seen making for the lamp. The moment he
touched the chimney he jumped back with a cry and the
match dropped from his fingers.</p>

<p>"What ails you?" demanded Big John.</p>

<p>"Why, the chimney's <i>hot</i>!" exclaimed Merton.
"Somebody's been here, and they haven't been gone very
long, either."</p>

<p>"Thunder! It must have been Ross and Kinky. They
were to meet us here, you know, and Ross had a key
to the boathouse."</p>

<p>"If they were here a few minutes ago," went on Merton,
"why aren't they here now?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to pass that. But if any one was here, it
was those pals of mine. Go on and light the lamp. Use
your handkerchief for taking off the chimney."</p>

<p>Matt, under the overturned boat, drew a breath of
relief. But it was only a temporary relief. Already he
was wondering what would happen when Ross and
Kinky arrived at the rendezvous. Ross had told Matt
that he and Kinky were to meet Big John that night,
but had carried the impression that the meeting was to
take place in town.</p>

<p>Merton's fears were apparently relieved, and he soon
had the lamp lighted.</p>

<p>Big John divested himself of a raincoat and removed
a dripping cap. Coat and cap he hung very carefully
from two nails in the wall.</p>

<p>Merton, meanwhile, was unlocking a cupboard. A
bottle and two glasses came out of the cupboard. Merton
poured some of the liquor into the glasses. Big
John reached over and emptied part of Merton's glass
into his own.</p>

<p>"That leaves enough for you, son, and a heap more
than you ought to have," said he. "It ain't good for
younkers&mdash;nor for old fellers, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, splash!" grunted Merton. "You ought to go
around with a pocketful of tracts," he grinned. "Whenever
you rob a man, leave a tract with him."</p>

<p>"You're mighty cute," observed Big John, setting his
empty glass on the table and leaning back in his chair,
"but the two of us wasn't cute enough to get the best
of Motor Matt. There's a boy! He's a bright and
shinin' example. He has backcapped me twice, and the
more he does it the more I admire him."</p>

<p>Merton stared; then, developing his silver cigarette
case and his silver match box, he proceeded to smoke.</p>

<p>"You're a queer fish, Big John," said he. "If you've
got such high standards, why don't you live up to 'em?"</p>

<p>Big John shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>"I expect it ain't in me," he answered.</p>

<p>"If you'd had Ross and Kinky with you, there at the
bend in the Waunakee road, this Motor Matt wouldn't
have made a get-away."</p>

<p>"Mebby not; but Ross is down on Motor Matt and
wouldn't hesitate to hand him his finish. That's the
reason I wouldn't have Ross along; and I let Kinky stay
with Ross as a sort of safeguard, in case anythin' went
crossways and Ross happened to find Motor Matt. Only
the hope of me gettin' that money has caused Ross to
hold back as long as he has. Now that he knows there's
no hope of gettin' the money, he'll be as mad as a cannibal.
Ross is worse'n an Apache Injun when he's
worked up."</p>

<p>"Then he'll be mad when he comes here and finds you
didn't get the money, won't he?"</p>

<p>"He will; and I've laid my plans to make a quick
jump for the West. I'll land that precious Ross where
he won't get us all into trouble."</p>

<p>"You were telling me that you had set old man Lorry
against Motor Matt."</p>

<p>A slow grin worked its way over Big John's face.</p>

<p>"Anonymous letter," said he. "I just wrote Lorry
that I was a detective, and didn't think it wise to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
my information over my own name, see? Then I went
on to tell him to look out for Motor Matt, and explained
that he was in cahoots with the three desperate scoundrels
who had stolen the ten thousand in 'Frisco. That'll
make Lorry think a little. But see here, son. You
haven't been private adviser for young Lorry just to
make a man of him in the gamblin' line, have you?
What's your graft? I'll bet it's somethin' more than
getting him away from his mother's apron strings, and
out of the sissy class."</p>

<p>Merton's sinister face took on a crafty look.</p>

<p>"You're right," said he. "The Winnequa Club has a
race in a few days. For reasons of my own, I intend to
win that race. See? Lorry also wanted to have a boat
in the race, and he's about the only one, apart from me,
whose dad has money enough to furnish him with a boat
that will make the rest of us climb. But old man Lorry
isn't furnishing George with the boat." Merton chuckled.
"When George asked me what he ought to do the time
his father threatened to send him to military school, I
told George to skip, and to get as far away as he could.
That left me free to do as I wanted to in that motor-boat
event."</p>

<p>Merton winked.</p>

<p>"H'm!" murmured Big John. "You're a foxy youngster.
I'm not sayin' it's creditable in you, mind, but it
shows sharp thinking, all right."</p>

<p>The three boys under the overturned boat were able
to see and hear all that went on. When the conversation
between Merton and Big John had proceeded that
far, Matt heard a sharp breath escape Lorry's lips.</p>

<p>A few words, and Merton's despicable planning had
been laid bare. Out of Merton's own mouth Lorry could
judge him. This false friend, with whom Lorry had
associated, and whose advice he had taken, had headed
him toward irretrievable ruin.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can be foxy if I want to," said Merton. "All
I want now is to make sure that Lorry doesn't get in
that race."</p>

<p>"I guess you can be easy on that point," returned Big
John dryly. "The old gent won't put up money for the
boat on a bet. Motor Matt called on Lorry. I talked
with Gus, the Lorry chauffeur, and he said there was
a heap of coldness developed durin' the interview, and
that when Motor Matt had left, Lorry used the telephone
and asked police headquarters to have a plain-clothes
man pick up his trail and follow him. The fly
cop followed Motor Matt from Third Lake into Fourth,
but lost him somewhere around the Mendota end of the
Catfish. The last thing I did, before leaving Madison
to come here, was to drop another unsigned letter in the
mails for Lorry."</p>

<p>"What was that for?" asked Merton.</p>

<p>"I told Lorry that if he would cross Fourth Lake in
the morning, and proceed up the Catfish as far as
Whisky Creek, then leave the boat and walk up the creek
for a mile, he would come to the place where Motor
Matt was having McGlory keep his son. I reckon <i>that</i>
will give Motor Matt something to think about. I'll not
be here to see the fun, and I guess young King will get
out of the scrape in his customary fashion, but it'll be
something by way of remembering Big John. King has
made me a lot o' trouble, and has beat me out of a pineapple
plantation, and that's all I can do to rough things
up for him. You see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Big John broke off suddenly. Some one else was approaching
the boathouse. Matt, McGlory, and Lorry
could hear the footsteps plainly.</p>

<p>Merton started to get up, but Big John lifted a restraining
hand.</p>

<p>"If they're the ones we expect," said he, "they've got
a key and can let themselves in. If they're not the ones
we're looking for, then we don't want them here."</p>

<p>A key rattled in the lock just as Big John finished
speaking. The next moment the door opened and two
men blew in.</p>

<p>They were Ross and Kinky!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DASH FOR THE OPEN.</p>


<p>That visit of Matt, McGlory, and Lorry to the boathouse
was worth all the danger it had brought, even if
it had resulted in nothing more than opening Lorry's
eyes to the duplicity of his supposed friend.</p>

<p>But other things had developed that were highly interesting,
as well as edifying.</p>

<p>Matt was astounded to learn that an anonymous letter
had made the elder Lorry so bitterly hostile. If Lorry
had put so much faith in one unsigned letter, surely he
would have equal confidence in the second, and might be
expected to cross the lake on the following morning and
make his way to the cabin on the creek.</p>

<p>It was likewise refreshing to learn that Big John was
intending to take his two pals and return to the West.
Matt was not forgetting that Ross and Kinky had some
three hundred dollars of his money, and before the flight
something must be done to recover the funds.</p>

<p>But just then a common danger suggested that the
boys must get away from the boathouse. There were
four enemies against them, and at least three of the enemies
were armed.</p>

<p>"We've got to get out of here, Joe," whispered Matt.</p>

<p>"Why not lay low till <i>they</i> get out?" returned the
cowboy.</p>

<p>"It won't be possible. That hot lamp chimney is going
to do the trick for us. Big John will mention it and
ask Ross and Kinky why they left the boathouse and
went out into the rain. Ross and Kinky will say they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
didn't; then there'll be talk and a hunt for intruders.
We've got to make a dash for the open&mdash;and at once."</p>

<p>"You've got it right, Motor Matt," murmured Lorry.
"The quicker I can get away from here, the better I'll
like it. I've learned a lot," and there was bitterness in
Lorry's voice as he finished.</p>

<p>"Let's heave over the boat and make a dash for the
back door," suggested McGlory. "We're rushin' straight
into the dark, and, if we're quick, we can get clear before
there's any shooting."</p>

<p>"That hits me," said Lorry.</p>

<p>"It's now or never, then," assented Matt. "Separate,
just outside the boathouse, and then come together
again at the launch. We'll go up to that cave you fellows
found. You understand the plan, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Lorry and McGlory.</p>

<p>"Then lay hold of the edge of the boat," went on
Matt.</p>

<p>In their narrow quarters the three boys knelt, waiting
for the word to lift the boat's edge from the skids and
throw the hulk entirely over. It was not a large boat,
and their strength was fully equal to the task they had
set for themselves.</p>

<p>"<i>Now!</i>" hissed Matt.</p>

<p>Over went the boat with a crash. Startled yells came
from the sitting room, followed by silence broken only
by a rush of feet as Matt, Lorry, and McGlory darted
toward the rear door.</p>

<p>"Stop 'em!" roared Big John.</p>

<p>"Guns!" cried Ross; "use your guns!"</p>

<p>McGlory halted and whirled. At the side of the boat
he had found a small can of white lead, which was
probably to do its part in giving the hull a coat of paint.
When starting to run the cowboy had taken the can of
lead with him.</p>

<p>He paused to hurl the can. Straight as a bullet it
shot through the air, crashed into the lamp, and plunged
the interior of the boathouse in darkness. Another moment
and McGlory had hurled himself through the door.</p>

<p>Acting upon Matt's suggestion, the three friends separated
as soon as they reached the outside air. Ten
minutes later they were all together again at the place
where the <i>Sprite</i> was moored.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the storm, and for a while, at
least, the rain had stopped.</p>

<p>Matt began ripping off the boat's tarpaulin cover.</p>

<p>"Cast off the painter, Joe," he called, as he worked.
"You can help me with this, George," he added. "Never
mind the skiff&mdash;we can't bother with that now."</p>

<p>Clearing a working space aft of the hood, Matt leaped
into the boat and began getting the motor into action.
George finished removing the "tarp," and McGlory
scrambled aboard with the end of the painter.</p>

<p>From the direction of the boathouse sounds of pursuit
could be heard.</p>

<p>"Tumble in, George," called Matt. "You can finish
that from inside the boat."</p>

<p>McGlory gave his cousin a hand and Matt started the
propeller.</p>

<p>Taking the launch up the river on such a night was
hazardous in the extreme. But Matt had the bearings
of the stream in his head, and he urged the <i>Sprite</i> boldly
onward.</p>

<p>From behind them, somewhere, a revolver was fired.
The leaden missile caused no damage, and the launch
rushed on into the gloom.</p>

<p>Lorry, who knew the river well, pushed to Matt's side
to be of what help he could.</p>

<p>"You never had a better chance to wreck a boat,
Motor Matt," said Lorry, "than you've got right now."</p>

<p>"I'm hoping for the best," returned Matt. "Instinct,
more than anything else, is guiding me. I don't know,
but I seem to <i>feel</i> it when we're going wrong."</p>

<p>It was the same instinct, perhaps, which carries a
horse over the right road when the rider is lost, or that
carries a bird miles and miles through the air to the
same nest in the same tree of the forest.</p>

<p>This was not the first time Matt had profited by that
vague intuition. It was almost like a sixth sense.</p>

<p>McGlory, time and again, held his breath, fearing that
they were about to run upon the rocks; but, just as
surely, time and again, the king of the motor boys turned
the wheel and deep water remained under them.</p>

<p>"It's up to you fellows to tell me where to stop," said
Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm watching for the place," replied Lorry, "but the
shore line looks like a solid blur of shadow. I can't distinguish
one point from another."</p>

<p>"Figure it out by dead-reckoning," suggested Matt.
"You must have some idea, George, how far the cave
is from the lake."</p>

<p>"Two miles, I should say."</p>

<p>"Then, at this speed, we've covered the two miles,"
and Matt shut off the power and let the boat's momentum
carry her toward the bank.</p>

<p>The <i>Sprite</i> came to a halt with a slight jar, which
proved that she had struck.</p>

<p>"That's all right," announced Matt, "and we're close
enough to tie up. Never mind if we do get our feet
wet; we're in luck to get out of that boathouse as well
as we did."</p>

<p>"You can gamble the limit on that," answered McGlory,
splashing ashore with the painter. "I'm a Digger,
too, if this place don't look familiar to me, what little I
can see of it."</p>

<p>"It's familiar to me, too," exulted Lorry. "Why, fellows,
we're within a hundred feet of the cave! Talk
about luck, will you? This lays over anything that ever
came my way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt replaced the tarpaulin, got over the side, and
waded to the bank. Lorry and McGlory led him upward
for a dozen feet to a place where the bank broke away
in a sort of narrow shelf. Something like a hundred feet
along this shelf was the opening into the cavern. The
entrance was masked with hazels, but the boys crowded
in, and soon found themselves in dry quarters.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that boathouse, please!" guffawed
the cowboy, stretching himself out on the uneven stone
floor. "Were Big John and his pals surprised! I rather
guess they were."</p>

<p>"Tell us more about that attempt Big John and Merton
made to rob you on the Waunakee road," said Lorry.
"It seems strange that Merton should have a hand in
anything like that, or that he should be mixed up with
this gang of scoundrels at all. Merton's folks are immensely
wealthy. They're traveling in Europe now, and
Merton is in Madison attending the university. Mert
is a spender, all right, and all he has to do when he
wants money is to ask for it. Why should he help Big
John try to get that ten thousand from you, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Possibly it wasn't the money end of the deal that attracted
Merton," answered Matt. "It may be that all he
wanted, Lorry, was to make you as much trouble as he
could."</p>

<p>Lorry muttered angrily under his breath.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I ever let him pull the wool over
my eyes," said he, "but it's a fact that I considered
Ollie Merton my best friend. It was by his advice that
I took that money and went to 'Frisco."</p>

<p>"That, alone," remarked Matt earnestly, "proves that
Merton was not a friend."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to see it in that light myself," admitted
Lorry. "It's hard to have to say so, but it's the truth."</p>

<p>"Hard!" scoffed McGlory. "Why, pard, the way
you're showin' up is sure hard to beat. But don't hang
fire with that yarn of yours, Matt. You've got ours,
and all George and I need is a statement of facts from
you in order to get the whole business straight in our
own minds. Heave ahead now, and be quick about it.
I'm about ready to doze off."</p>

<p>Matt began with his start for Waunakee, related the
attempted robbery, and the manner in which he and
Ethel Lorry had backed the runabout along the Waunakee
road and into Madison.</p>

<p>The part Matt dreaded to tell had to do with his interview
with Lorry's father; but Lorry had shown such
a surprising change in his whole manner of thought and
action that Matt detailed the conversation between himself
and Mr. Lorry exactly as it had occurred.</p>

<p>A few days before, such a report would have sent
George into a furious tirade against his father, but he
now listened quietly and without comment.</p>

<p>Matt, highly pleased, proceeded to tell how he had
taken the launch from the express office, had engaged
Pickerel Pete, and had run the <i>Sprite</i> into Fourth Lake
and up the Catfish; then followed his visit to the cabin,
his failure to find McGlory and Lorry, his return to the
launch, his capture by a ruse on the part of Ross, and,
finally, the murderous attempt which Ross had made and
which had come so near being successful.</p>

<p>"That Ross must be bug-house!" growled McGlory
angrily.</p>

<p>"He had been drinking," said Matt. "A man will do
things when he's partly intoxicated that he wouldn't
think of doing when sober."</p>

<p>"You're out three hundred dollars, Matt," spoke up
Lorry, "and I don't think that money will ever come
back to you. When we made that dash from the boathouse,
Big John and his pals knew we had been there
long enough to learn a whole lot about their plans. Ross
and Kinky have discovered that you were saved from
the burning boat, even if they didn't know it before, and
all three of the rascals will not lose a minute getting
away from this part of the country. I doubt if it would
do any good for us to go to Madison and report to the
police. Big John and his pals are done with Madison,
and with you. They'll make tracks for where they came
from, and they'll do it at once."</p>

<p>"That sounds like pretty good reasoning to me," observed
Matt, "but I guess that what we've accomplished
is worth all it cost us. What are your plans, Lorry?"</p>

<p>"I'm going home in the morning," declared Lorry.
"If I'm to go to a military school&mdash;well, there are worse
places."</p>

<p>"Listen to George!" cried McGlory. "Oh, tell me
about George! Ain't he a surprise party, though?"</p>

<p>"Now," said Matt jubilantly, "I'm <i>sure</i> that what
we've accomplished is worth the price. Good night,
pards. I've found a soft stone, and I've got material for
pleasant dreams, so I'm going to sleep. In the morning,
we're for across the lake&mdash;and Aristocracy Hill!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE POWER BOAT&mdash;MINUS THE POWER.</p>


<p>The boys were astir early, it being their intention to
reach Madison and the Lorry home before Mr. Lorry
could get away to cross the lake&mdash;providing that proved
to be his intention.</p>

<p>The boys had a frugal breakfast off the cold food
McGlory and Lorry had brought from the cabin, and
immediately after they emerged from the cave upon the
narrow shelf that ran in front of it.</p>

<p>The rain seemed to be over, and the leaden clouds
were being scattered by a fierce wind from the west.</p>

<p>"This is a bad morning to be on Fourth Lake," said
George, casting an anxious eye upward. "I had hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the wind would blow itself out, but it appears to be as
strong as ever."</p>

<p>"Why not leave the <i>Sprite</i> here," suggested McGlory,
"and hike for Madison along the wagon road?"</p>

<p>"It would take us too long," protested Matt. "I think
a boat that can stand the seas in 'Frisco Bay ought to
be able to negotiate this fresh-water lake. The <i>Sprite's</i>
reliable, I can say that for her; and, so long as we have
power, I guess we needn't fear the wind."</p>

<p>"We'd better have a look at the boat by daylight,"
said McGlory. "For all we know, pards, the end may
have been burned off her."</p>

<p>But an examination showed that the <i>Sprite</i> had suffered
little damage from the fire. The luggage was
thrown aboard and the boys climbed to their places. One
turn of the flywheel and the cylinders took the spark;
then, on the reverse, the boat was pulled from the shoal
into deep water, Matt changed to the forward drive, and
they were off in a wide circle that pointed them for Lake
Mendota.</p>

<p>"I don't care a whoop what happens now," gloried
the cowboy, "we've got George out of the woods, and
that's the main thing."</p>

<p>"Call it that if you want to, Joe," said Lorry, "but
there's music for me to face, over on Fourth Lake
Ridge."</p>

<p>"And you're goin' to face it like a little man, Georgie;
and if Uncle Dan don't back down on that military-school
proposition he'll get a cold blast from Joe McGlory.
And that, pards," the cowboy added, "is a shot that goes
as it lays."</p>

<p>"I'll take my medicine and not make much of a face,
no matter how bitter the dose is," went on George; "but
there's one thing that's bound to happen."</p>

<p>"Meanin' which, George?" inquired McGlory.</p>

<p>"Why, my father is going to be set right on the subject
of Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Don't let me cause any friction between you, George,"
urged Matt. "The breach between you and your father
is in a fair way of being healed."</p>

<p>"So far as I am concerned," said Lorry, a flush tinging
his cheeks, "I'm willing to admit that I acted like a fool.
I'll go on record with that, face to face with the governor;
I'll even go further and say that it was weakness
that made me hang back from Madison, stop in that
cabin, and send Motor Matt on to make a dicker and
save my pride. But the governor has got to understand
that Motor Matt's my friend, and that, but for him and
you, Joe, I'd not be here now. Right is right, and Motor
Matt is going to have justice, if nothing more."</p>

<p>"I'm glad as blazes, George," caroled McGlory, "to
hear you tune up in that fashion. The more I listen to
you, since last night, the better I feel."</p>

<p>"I was quite a while getting to sleep in that cave,"
pursued Lorry. "I lay there, on the hard rocks, and
reviewed everything I've done since leaving Madison. It
seems as though a fog had been cleared out of my
brain, and that I was able to stand off and get a clean-cut,
impersonal look at myself. The sight wasn't pleasing.
I know why Motor Matt suggested that stop at
Waunakee, and a probation in the cabin on the creek.
He read me better than I could read myself. He knew
that I had pride which would not suffer humiliation
and disgrace, and that if I was not pampered and humored
a little I would probably go off on another rebellious
splurge&mdash;and wind up my future prospects. By
staying at that cabin, I brought all these dangers upon
Matt; and yet, if he had not suggested some such move
as the halt at Waunakee, I should very likely have bolted
from the train between 'Frisco and here. Oh, what an
unreasoning idiot I have been!"</p>

<p>Lorry dropped down on a seat and bowed his head in
his hands.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this, Matt!" whispered McGlory,
placing himself alongside the king of the motor boys.
"Who'd ever have dreamed my haughty, high-and-mighty
cousin would ever have come to the scratch in
such a way? Sufferin' tyrants! I wonder if Uncle Dan
is going to do the right thing by George, or make as
big a fool of himself as George did?"</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Lorry, after he sees and talks with
George, will do the right thing," returned Matt.</p>

<p>Just here the <i>Sprite</i> shot out of the river into the
rolling waters of Fourth Lake. The west wind, marshaling
its strength on the broad sweep of the prairies,
caught up the waves and flung them headlong toward
Maple Bluff. The launch leaped and staggered, shoved
her bow into the highest waves, and then shivered and
flung off the spray in a double cataract on each side.</p>

<p>It was a nerve-tingling ride, and McGlory suddenly
made up his mind that his stomach would feel better if
he sat down.</p>

<p>George, his face flushed with excitement, looked
around him and gave a jubilant shout.</p>

<p>"Great!" he cried.</p>

<p>"I wish I felt like that," groaned McGlory. "For
Heaven's sake, Matt, see how quick you can get us to
the other side."</p>

<p>"We can tie up at the yacht club on the west shore,"
said Lorry.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Matt. "Look at that boat over
there, George," he added, nodding his head in the direction
of Governor's Island. "She's the only other boat
on the lake, so far as I can see, and she's acting as
though something is wrong with her."</p>

<p>Lorry stood up, braced himself, and peered ahead.</p>

<p>"She's a bigger boat than ours," he remarked, "and
looked to me like the <i>Stella</i>. The <i>Stella</i> is a thirty-footer,
and belongs to Barkley Cameron, a neighbor of ours
up on the Hill. By Jupiter," he added, a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
later, "it is the <i>Stella</i>, and she's in trouble, as sure as
you're a foot high."</p>

<p>"The wind is driving her toward the Bluff," said
Matt excitedly. "Her engine's dead&mdash;she hasn't any
power to fight the wind and waves."</p>

<p>"And there are four men aboard her," went on Lorry.
"Great Scott! If they ever go on those rocks at the
point, the boat will be smashed to kindling and every
one aboard of her drowned. Let's stand by the <i>Stella</i>,
Matt, and try and do something for her."</p>

<p>"I'm rushing the <i>Sprite</i> in the <i>Stella's</i> direction," answered
Matt, "and have been for some time. But we
may not be able to do anything. She's half a mile nearer
the rocks than we are, and she may go onto them before
we can overhaul her."</p>

<p>Far off, just beyond the drifting and helpless launch,
Matt and Lorry could see the white waves flinging
themselves against the jutting crags of McBride's Point.
The <i>Sprite</i> was coming up with the <i>Stella</i> hand over
fist, but the <i>Stella's</i> drift was carrying her toward the
cliffs with tremendous speed.</p>

<p>"I can see the people on board," cried George, "and
two of them are tinkering with the engine. If they
can get the motor in shape they're all right, but if they
can't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>George broke off abruptly, and stood clinging to Matt
and staring at the other boat with frenzied eyes. Two
of the <i>Stella's</i> passengers, as Matt could see, were looking
toward the <i>Sprite</i> and waving their hands frantically.</p>

<p>"Matt," called George huskily, "one of those men is
my father!"</p>

<p>"Great guns!" gasped Matt. "He started across the
lake in the <i>Stella</i>. We didn't leave the Catfish quick
enough. But keep your nerve, George. We're going to
save them if we have to run into the breakers and pull
the <i>Stella</i> off the cliff!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A RECONCILIATION.</p>


<p>McGlory aroused himself for a moment, and learned
what the excitement was all about. Straightway he
forgot his physical ills and became absorbed in the wonderful
race Motor Matt was running with death. By
every trick in his power the king of the motor boys
was doing his utmost to urge the <i>Sprite</i> onward. The
boat's speed became a terrific dash, a headlong hustle,
with wind and wave helping the propeller.</p>

<p>"We'll never make it!" groaned George.</p>

<p>"Buck up, George!" cried McGlory. "Motor Matt has
done harder things than this."</p>

<p>"But the <i>Stella</i> will be on the rocks before we can get
to her! And there's the governor, likely to meet his
fate right under my eyes! Oh, what a scoundrel I have
been! Seeing the governor like this, perhaps for the
last time, makes me realize what I have done. He was
crossing the lake to find me, Joe."</p>

<p>George's voice died to a whisper and ended in a dry
sob.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together, I tell you!" roared McGlory.
"Now's the time to show yourself a <i>man</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yell to them to stand ready to throw a rope," said
Matt, between his teeth. "We can't get alongside of
them before they hit the rocks, but we can come near
enough so we can catch a rope if there's a strong enough
arm to pass it."</p>

<p>Lorry cast aside his overpowering doubts and fears
and flung himself into the fight with demoniacal energy.</p>

<p>"Stand ready with a rope!" he yelled, trumpeting
through his hands and doing his best to make his voice
heard above the roar and crash of the waves.</p>

<p>Again and again he repeated it, and McGlory joined
in, timing his voice with his cousin's.</p>

<p>One of the men who had been working at the engine
suddenly left his thankless labor and placed himself well
forward on the <i>Stella</i> at the point nearest to the approaching
<i>Sprite</i>.</p>

<p>"Make ready to grab the rope, both of you!" shouted
Matt. "If you're lucky enough to grab it, take a half-hitch
around the stern stanchion, and lay back on the
end of the rope with every ounce of power in your
bodies! There, stand by! They're going to throw!"</p>

<p>Matt shifted the wheel and, for a minute, placed the
<i>Sprite</i> broadside on to wind and waves. This gave the
man with the rope a better mark.</p>

<p>Out shot the coil of hemp, but the resistance of the
wind caused it to fall pitifully short.</p>

<p>A cry of despair went up from Lorry.</p>

<p>"Once more!" yelled McGlory, as Matt pointed the
<i>Sprite</i> straight for the <i>Stella</i> and flung her onward.</p>

<p>The man rapidly coiled the rope in his hands. Another
man stepped forward and took the rope to make
the next cast himself. He was a more powerfully built
man than the one who had attempted the first cast.</p>

<p>"This will tell the story," cried George. "If this
throw fails the <i>Stella</i> will be smashed to pieces on the
bluff."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory knew that fully as well as Lorry;
and those on the <i>Stella</i> must have realized it.</p>

<p>The man with the rope was cool and deliberate. It
was plain he was not going to waste any valuable chances
by undue haste; then, as he was whirling the rope to let
it fly, Matt again turned the <i>Sprite</i> broadside on.</p>

<p>For an instant it looked as though the rope was again
to fall short; but Lorry, stretching far out from the
side of the <i>Sprite</i>, snatched the end of the rope out of
the air with convulsive fingers, and fell with it to the
bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>A faint cheer went up from those on the <i>Stella</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>But the battle was not yet won. McGlory went to
the assistance of Lorry, and the slack of the cable was
jerked out of the water. This gave sufficient rope for
a half-hitch around the stanchion and a firm hand hold.
The cowboy and his cousin lay back on the line, bracing
their feet against the thwarts and clinging with all their
strength.</p>

<p>Motor Matt, meanwhile, had been busy with his part
of the work. The instant the rope was made fast, he
had shifted the bow of the <i>Sprite</i>, switching off the
power for a moment in order to lessen the shock when
the launch should begin to feel the pull.</p>

<p>Yet even with this precaution the shock was tremendous.
But nothing gave way, and slowly but surely
the <i>Sprite</i> took up her burden.</p>

<p>For a few moments the two boats seemed to stand
stationary, the power of the <i>Sprite</i> just counterbalancing
the push of wind and wave against both boats; then,
a little later, the <i>Sprite</i> began to move, gathering headway
by slow degrees.</p>

<p>Anything like speed was out of the question, but the
<i>Sprite</i>, without missing a shot, plowed her way like a
tugboat through the churning waters, and brought herself
and her tow safely along the yacht club's pier.</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory, busy making the <i>Sprite</i> fast,
caught a glimpse of George rushing across the pier to
meet his father.</p>

<p>"George!" shouted the elder man.</p>

<p>"Dad!" cried George.</p>

<p>And they came together, gripping each other's hands.
With arms locked they walked the length of the pier
and vanished inside the yacht club's headquarters.</p>

<p>"Reconciliation?" queried McGlory. "If it isn't, I
don't know the brand. Oh, I reckon Uncle Dan will do
the right thing by George. That cold blast of mine will
have to be permanently retired. Matt, give us your
paw! This is a grand day for the Lorry tribe!"</p>

<p>"No doubt about that, Joe," answered Matt, with
feeling, as he and McGlory shook hands.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Matt went into the yacht club to
telephone police headquarters about his stolen money.
He had only a very faint hope of ever seeing the money
again, but he felt it his duty to do everything possible
to recover it.</p>

<p>Over the 'phone he gave a description of Big John,
Ross, and Kinky.</p>

<p>The man at the other end of the line had just promised
to do what he could when Matt was caught by a
strong hand and turned around. He was once more face
to face with Lorry, Sr. But there was a difference in
the Lorry of Matt's first and second meeting.</p>

<p>"By gad!" cried Lorry, "I want to shake hands with
a hero. Nobly done, young man! But for you we'd
have gone to smash against Maple Bluff, every last one
of us on the <i>Stella</i>. We had our little differences when
we met, that other time, Motor Matt, but I didn't understand
the matter then. George here has been telling
me how much he owes to you, how much I owe to you,
how much I owe to him, and we all owe to McGlory,
and everybody owes to everybody else. Gad! my head
is fair splitting with it all. Never mind that three hundred
that was taken away from you; I guess"&mdash;and the
rich man laughed&mdash;"that my bank account is good for
three hundred. I'll see that <i>you</i> don't lose anything.
We'll have more talk about this later."</p>

<p>Lorry, Sr., turned to where McGlory was standing,
at Matt's side, his black eyes gleaming humorously.</p>

<p>"Ah, Joe, you rascal," went on Lorry, placing two
hands on the cowboy's shoulders, "you've done something
to make us all proud of you&mdash;and I guess you'll find it
out before you're many days older."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do for George, uncle?"
queried McGlory.</p>

<p>"You watch! Keep your eyes skinned and you'll see
me do something for you as well as for George."</p>

<p>Lorry, Sr., pushed himself between Matt and McGlory
and caught each of them by an arm.</p>

<p>"Come on, my lads!" said he, "you're both going up to
the house with George and me. This is a happy day,
and the Lorrys are going to celebrate. Naturally, the
celebration won't be complete without Motor Matt and
Joe. Never mind your boat&mdash;I've asked the people here
to look after it. Gus is outside with the big car, and
all we've got to do is to get in and strike out for home.
<i>Home!</i> How does that sound to you, my son?"</p>

<p>"It has a truer ring, dad," answered George, "than it
ever had before."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's a different home, George," answered Mr.
Lorry. "Anyhow, we'll try to make it so."</p>

<p>It was the sudden change in the color of the water that
made Nick Salveson realize something was wrong.</p>

<p>All day thunder had been muttering far up in the mountains,
but down in the river valley the autumn sun had been
shining warm; and, busy with his fishing, Nick had paid no
attention to the heavy clouds which hung over the jagged
peaks upstream.</p>

<p>Suddenly the water lost its crystal clearness, and turned
to a yellow, muddy hue, and the canoe began to strain at
her anchor rope.</p>

<p>"Reckon it's about time to quit," muttered the young fellow;
and, hastily reeling in his line, he laid the rod down
and set to work to pull up the anchor.</p>

<p>It was badly jammed between two rocks at the bottom.
By the time he had cleared it the river had risen at least
two feet, and was roaring down in a sheet of muddy foam.</p>

<p>"Guess there's been a cloud burst up in the hills," said
Nick to himself as he turned the bow of the canoe upstream.</p>

<p>He was not uneasy. He had spent the whole summer in
Alaska, and could handle a canoe as well as most boys of
his age.</p>

<p>He had been anchored close in under the far bank. To
reach his camp he had to cross the whole width of the
river, and return nearly a mile upstream.</p>

<p>But he had not taken six strokes before he realized that
two strong men could not have paddled the canoe back
against the flood that was now coming down. The only
thing to do was to get across, land anywhere he could,
pull the canoe up, and walk back.</p>

<p>"Great ghost! but it's strong," he muttered, as, in spite of
his efforts, the bow of the canoe was swung sideways by the
weight of the water.</p>

<p>He leaned forward, drove the paddle deep in the yellow
flood, and, with all his weight in the stroke, attempted to
force her round.</p>

<p>Crack! The paddle, worn thin with weeks of hard wear,
snapped like a pipestem. Nick was left with a mere foot or
so of useless stump. The blade was gone.</p>

<p>Instantly the rising flood seized the canoe and sent her
flying madly downstream. Like a feather she danced and
spun among the whirling yellow eddies.</p>

<p>Recovering from the sudden shock of the accident, Nick
made a desperate effort to steer inshore by using the stump
of the paddle. It was useless. The flood, rising every minute,
mocked his best efforts.</p>

<p>At last, streaming with perspiration, and with his heart
beating like a hammer, he gave it up, and sat grimly quiet
and silent. There was something of the stoicism of the
Indian in this son of a San Francisco millionaire. He had
done his best. Now the only thing was to wait and see what
the river would do with him.</p>

<p>Mile after mile the relentless current bore him flying westward.
Soon he was past all his landmarks, and speeding
through country completely unknown to him. Once or twice
the river contracted dangerously between walls of rock,
and the canoe pitched and plunged among foam-tipped waves.
But for the most part the banks were hillsides covered with
primeval forest of fir and hemlock. There was nowhere
any sign of man.</p>

<p>"It'll take me all my time to get back even if I do manage
to hit the bank somewhere," said Nick to himself
grimly, as he noted the tangled thickness of the woods on
either hand.</p>

<p>He was in a tight place; he knew that. What he hoped
was that some freak of the current would drive the canoe
near enough to the bank to catch hold of a branch and so
pull himself ashore.</p>

<p>But this did not happen, and, after his mad flight had
lasted for a full hour, Nick became desperately anxious. In
the distance, he could see that the valley narrowed greatly,
and he more than suspected that he was approaching dangerous
rapids.</p>

<p>He swung round a curve. Yes, he was right. Barely
half a mile away the whole river plunged into a gorge so
narrow it looked like a mere crack in the cliff. The shriek
of the tortured waters rang high above the roar of the flood
which bore the canoe onward to its doom.</p>

<p>Nick was no fool. He knew that in all human possibility
his fate was sealed. No craft that man ever built could
hope to pass in safety down the raging flood that boiled
through that rift in the mountain.</p>

<p>"Rotten luck!" he muttered. "Well, there's one comfort&mdash;there's
no one to miss me except old Rube, and I don't remember
I ever did any one a dirty trick in my life."</p>

<p>Every instant the scream of the rapids grew louder. Nick
could see the mouth of the rift and the yellow waves heaping
themselves high against the black precipices on either hand.</p>

<p>On flashed the canoe. Every moment her speed increased.
She was a bare one hundred yards from the top of the rapids,
when a yell from the right-hand bank rose high above the
thunder of the flood, and Nick, turning his head, saw a small,
slight figure dashing down through the trees.</p>

<p>Just above the gate of the rapids half a dozen great
bowlders showed their black heads above the yellow foam.
Without a moment's hesitation the stranger leaped from the
bank to the nearest, and so from rock to rock, till he stood
far out near the centre of the raging river.</p>

<p>Nick watched him with straining eyes. Was there still
a bare chance? No! At that moment an eddy swept the
canoe away to the left. With a groan Nick realized that
she would pass far out of reach of his would-be rescuer.</p>

<p>The canoe shot like an arrow toward the lip of the fall.
Nick waved the broken stump of his paddle in farewell to
the figure on the rocks.</p>

<p>The latter's right arm whirled up, and, with a sharp
hiss, a coil of rope flashed out and dropped clean and true
across the canoe.</p>

<p>Nick snatched at it with the energy of despair. As it
tightened, the canoe was drawn away from under him, and
he, dragged over the stern, was struggling in the rushing
water.</p>

<p>A minute of gasping, stifling battle among the tumbling,
roaring waves. The strain on the rope was so tremendous
that it seemed to Nick that either it must break or the man
who held it must be pulled off his slippery perch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>But neither happened, and inch by inch the boy was
drawn in, until a hand grasped him and pulled him, gasping
and exhausted, onto the solid summit of the bowlder.</p>

<p>"Can you jump?" He heard an anxious voice. "The
water's still rising. It'll be over the rock soon."</p>

<p>"You bet I can," replied Nick, struggling to his feet and
shaking himself like a dog.</p>

<p>"Come on, then!" cried the other. And, sure-footed as a
goat, he sprang across six feet of raging torrent to the
next rock. Nick set his teeth and followed, and in another
minute was safe ashore beside his rescuer.</p>

<p>"Mean to say you live here all alone!" exclaimed Nick
Salveson in blank amazement, as he looked round the bare
little log hut a little later.</p>

<p>"Yes, for the last four months, ever since my father
left."</p>

<p>"Did he go down to the coast?"</p>

<p>"I wish he had. No, he went inland, over the Big
Snowies!"</p>

<p>"Great Scott! What for?" asked Nick bluntly.</p>

<p>"Gold," replied the other. "I'll tell you about it. My
name's Glenn&mdash;Roger Glenn. We came here a year ago
prospecting. We heard there was gold down here, but we
didn't do much, and an Indian who was snowbound here
last winter told my father that there was rich placer ground
the other side of the mountains."</p>

<p>"But no one's ever been across there," objected Nick.
"There's no pass."</p>

<p>"The Indian told us there was. He made a map. Here's
a copy of it."</p>

<p>"So your dad tried it?" said Nick, staring curiously at the
rough map.</p>

<p>"He went the first of June last, and I've not seen or
heard of him since. He said he'd be back in six or eight
weeks."</p>

<p>"Gee, but that's bad," replied Nick sympathetically. "What
do you reckon you are to do?"</p>

<p>"What can I do?" cried young Glenn bitterly. "I'm mad
to go after him, but I haven't a red cent to grubstake myself
or buy a pony or dogs or a sledge."</p>

<p>Nick stared in silence at the other for some seconds. Then
he said slowly:</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Glenn, that flood may have done us both a good
turn. What d'ye say to taking me along in your trip over
the Snowies?"</p>

<p>Roger stared violently.</p>

<p>"B-but&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"No 'buts' about it. I'm running this outfit. Look here,
Roger&mdash;I guess you don't mind my calling you by your first
name&mdash;I'm pretty well fixed. My people are dead; they
were killed in the earthquake in San Francisco. I'm my
own boss, though I am only eighteen, and I came up to
Alaska this summer to get a holiday before I go to the university
next Christmas. There isn't a thing I'd like better
than a trip over the Snowies, and if we're smart we'll do
it and be back before winter hits us. Are you agreeable?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you," said Roger brokenly.</p>

<p>"Then don't worry to try, old man," replied Nick comfortably.
"Just fix up a mouthful of grub, and give me a
bunk. We ought to start before sun-up to-morrow morning."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Seems to me, Rube, you were a bit out in your reckoning,"
said Nick as early one morning, ten days later, he
looked out of the tent and found the landscape white with
snow.</p>

<p>Rube shook his grizzled head.</p>

<p>"'Tain't that altogether, boss. I reckon we're a matter of
four thousand feet higher than your summer camp. Winter
comes here a sight sooner than down in them river valleys.
Howsomever, it ain't deep, and it'll melt when the sun gets
good an' strong."</p>

<p>All that day the little party of three struggled up a narrow
valley that wound ever upward into the heart of a maze of
great snow peaks. Over and over again tall cliffs loomed up
in front, and it seemed as if they could go no further. But
always there appeared some fresh opening, and bit by bit
they won their way upward toward the summit of the range.</p>

<p>"I reckoned as I knew this here country's well as any,"
said Rube, staring thoughtfully up at a tremendous pyramid
peak, the snow on which was gold and crimson in the light
of the setting sun. "But this beats me. 'Tain't on any map
as ever I seed."</p>

<p>"The Indian said no white man had ever crossed it," said
Roger.</p>

<p>"Hed he bin across hisself?" inquired Rube.</p>

<p>"No. He told dad that none of his tribe had ever been
across. And when dad asked him why, he only shook his
head, and said something about its being the country of two-tailed
devils."</p>

<p>"How did he know of this here pass then?" demanded
Rube.</p>

<p>"The map was given him by his father. It had come down
goodness knows how many generations. He tried awfully
hard to persuade dad not to go."</p>

<p>"They've got a mighty queer lot of legends about these
mountains," put in Nick. "You couldn't pay any Injun I
ever saw to put foot on 'em."</p>

<p>They camped that night in bitter cold and deep snow on
the very summit of the pass. Rube took Nick aside.</p>

<p>"Say, boss, do you reckon we're ever going to find Roger's
dad?"</p>

<p>Nick shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Roger says that before he left his father
told him he'd blaze a trail, so as if anything went wrong his
son could come along after. Roger found his father's mark
on a tree near the eastern end of the pass."</p>

<p>"Seems to me the chances are ez something hez happened
to old Glenn," said Rube thoughtfully. "Chewed by a b'ar,
I reckon. Or maybe had a fall. It's a fool job fer any man
to come into country like this by hisself."</p>

<p>"I guess I'm going as far as Roger wants," said Nick,
"Seeing what he's done for me, it's about the least I can do
for him."</p>

<p>"You're right, boss," said Rube. "He's a real white, that
boy is!"</p>

<p>"If we don't find his father, I'm going to take him back
to the States," said Nick. "But that's a bit o' news you can
keep to yourself for the present."</p>

<p>Next morning the sun shone brilliantly on the snow, and,
looking down, the party saw, thousands of feet below them,
an unknown country covered with a forest heavier than any
of them had ever seen before.</p>

<p>"Mighty curious-looking country this," observed Rube
doubtfully, as they slipped and slithered down the steep
snow-covered rocks. "I don't reckon I ever seed woods as
thick as them before."</p>

<p>"What's that queer-looking little plain halfway down?"
asked Nick. "Looks like a clearing of some kind."</p>

<p>A smile crossed Rube's leathery face.</p>

<p>"Thet's a pond, boss. It's fruz over, an' the snow's laying
thick on it."</p>

<p>Further down they came to a place where the only possible
track lay along the bottom of a three-hundred-foot
slope, steeper than the roof of a house and thick in snow,
which glared blinding white in the morning sun. The opposite
slope was covered with the amazingly thick forest
which they had seen from above.</p>

<p>"Go keerful," said Rube. "'Twouldn't take a great deal
to start a snowslide down them rocks."</p>

<p>"Seems as if something had been falling already," said
Roger suddenly. "Look at these pits in the snow."</p>

<p>He pointed to a hole in the snow. It was circular and
about two feet deep.</p>

<p>"Now that's strange," exclaimed Nick. "There's a whole
row of 'em."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Rube looked at the queer marks, grunted, and shook his
head. He hadn't a notion what they were, but did not like
to betray his ignorance to the boys.</p>

<p>"Reckon best not talk," he growled. "Don't take much
to start snow a-sliding."</p>

<p>For the next half mile no one spoke. Twice more Roger
noticed a series of the same queer marks in the snow. Also
in two places there seemed to be regular roads beaten back
into the thick underbrush of the snowclad forest on their
right. He did not pay much attention. His eyes were fixed
on the tree trunks.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a shout.</p>

<p>"Dad's mark!" he cried, pointing to a blaze on a big trunk
by the path.</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before there came
a deep crashing sound from somewhere behind.</p>

<p>"Yew've done it now!" cried Rube. "That's the snow!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," retorted Nick. "It's coming from the
wood."</p>

<p>"Blamed if you ain't right!" exclaimed Rube. "Thet beats
all. I never heerd a snowslide come down through a wood
afore."</p>

<p>"It's not snow; it's something alive!" shouted Roger.
"For heaven's sake, look there!"</p>

<p>Rooted to the ground with sheer amazement, the three
saw the forest wave as if it were grass, heard the crashing
of great boughs and trunks breaking like nettles under a boy's
stick.</p>

<p>There came a scream like the escape of steam from an
express engine, and then there burst out from the forest a
beast so huge and hideous that those who saw it stood gasping,
unable to believe their eyes.</p>

<p>As large as a four-roomed cottage, in shape it resembled
an elephant. It was covered all over with a thatch of coarse,
reddish hair, and high above its monstrous head it waved
a trunk of incredible size. On each side of this trunk curled
vast tusks, and its small, bloodshot eyes glowed with bestial
fury.</p>

<p>Again came that awful trumpeting. Instantly both the
pack ponies were off at a mad gallop.</p>

<p>"Run!" shrieked Rube.</p>

<p>The warning was needless. Nick and Roger were off as
hard as their shaking legs could carry them, and behind them
came the monster at a shambling gallop, which, in spite of
the snow, covered the ground at terrific speed.</p>

<p>Again he trumpeted, and one of the pack ponies, mad with
fright, tried to wheel sideways into the wood. The poor
brute slipped and fell, rolling over and over. Before it could
regain its feet the monster was upon it, and, lifting pony,
pack, and all, bodily in its trunk, flung it against the cliffside
with such frightful force as must have broken every bone
in its body.</p>

<p>The momentary delay gave the others a few yards' start;
but almost instantly the gigantic brute was on their track
again, and the solid ground shook beneath its ponderous
weight as it thundered down the slope.</p>

<p>It could not last. The monster was gaining at every stride.
Already Roger felt his breath failing. There was no cover;
in fact, the pass was opening out wider and wider as they
went.</p>

<p>"Try the trees!" shrieked Nick to Roger.</p>

<p>"No," came a gasp from Rube. "The lake! That's our
only chance!"</p>

<p>They were close by the side of the little frozen lake, and
the boys saw Rube wheel and dash down the steep bank.</p>

<p>It seemed madness, for on the open ice they were at the
mad brute's mercy. Roger was for going straight on, but
Nick seized his arm and swung him to the left and onto the
lake.</p>

<p>Another of those ear-piercing squeals. Roger, glancing
back over his shoulder, saw the gigantic bulk of their enemy
come plunging down the sharp descent toward the ice. It
rushed straight toward him as though certain of its prey.</p>

<p>Then came a rending crack, and the whole surface of the
ice rose and fell beneath the feet of the fugitives. A crash
like the explosion of a shell, a terrific bellow, and a wave
of icy water rushed across the frozen snow.</p>

<p>"That's done it!" came an exulting yell from Rube; and,
swinging round, the boys were just in time to see the
domelike head of their terrible enemy sink amid a lather
of broken ice and foam.</p>

<p>For another second or two that terrible trunk waved high
in the air, as the huge beast fought for its ancient life in the
hole its ponderous bulk had broken. Then this, too, vanished.
The last of the mammoths had sunk into the depths.</p>

<p>While the three stood in awe-stricken silence, watching the
black water heave and bubble, there came a loud shout from
the woods at the far end of the lake. A burly man in furs
stood waving a rifle.</p>

<p>With a shriek of joy Roger tore away across the ice toward
him.</p>

<p>"Reckon that's his pa," observed Rube.</p>

<p>"Guess so," agreed Nick. "We might as well go and
see."</p>

<p>"Dad!" cried Roger, as Rube and Nick came up. "If
it hadn't been for these good friends I could never have
come to look for you."</p>

<p>"Then," said the man in furs with a grave smile, "I'm
afraid I should have been hung up here for the term of my
natural life."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;did that old hairy elephant chase yer?" exclaimed
Rube.</p>

<p>"He did, and I got away by the skin of my teeth by
climbing a cliff," replied Mr. Glenn. "I've been living up
in the hills ever since. Time and again I've tried to find
another way out, but there isn't one, and for the life of me
I didn't dare risk conclusions a second time with the mammoth."</p>

<p>"I reckon he won't trouble us no more," said Rube dryly.
"Say, though, I'd like to have had them tusks. They'd be
worth a mint o' money in the States."</p>

<p>"They'd be awkward to carry," smiled Mr. Glenn. "They'd
weigh about a quarter of a ton apiece. What do you suppose
they'd be worth?"</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars, I reckon," said Rube. Such a sum
represented wealth untold to the old trapper.</p>

<p>Mr. Glenn put a hand in his coat pocket, and pulled out a
lump of dull yellow metal as big as his fist.</p>

<p>"This isn't worth quite that much," he said quietly, as he
handed it to Rube. "But I'd be glad if you'd take it as a
sort of consolation prize."</p>

<p>"Great gosh! It's a twenty-ounce nugget!" gasped Rube.</p>

<p>"Yes, and plenty more where that came from," said the
prospector.</p>

<p>He turned to his son.</p>

<p>"Roger, I've made the strike of a lifetime. Now to get
back to Dawson before the snow comes."</p>

<h2><a name="WATCH_THE_SKY" id="WATCH_THE_SKY">WATCH THE SKY.</a></h2>


<p>The different colors of the sky are caused by certain rays
of light being more or less strongly reflected or absorbed,
according to the amount of moisture contained in the atmosphere.
Such colors do, therefore, portend to some extent
the kind of weather that may naturally be expected to follow.
For instance, a red sunset indicates a fine day to follow, because
the air when dry refracts more red or heat-making
rays, and as dry air is not perfectly transparent, they are
again reflected in the horizon. A coppery or yellowish sunset
generally foretells rain. The following has been advocated
as a fairly successful way of prognosticating: Fix
your eye on the smallest cloud you can see: if it decreases
and disappears, the weather will be good; if it increases in
size, rain may be looked for.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
